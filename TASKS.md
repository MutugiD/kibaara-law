# Kibaara Law Application - Phase 2 Refactor

This document tracks the major refactoring effort to move from a static, proof-of-concept application to a dynamic, user-driven legal case analysis platform.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial FastAPI project setup.
- [x] Deployed and tested initial MVP on Azure.
- [x] Aligned on new application architecture and UI/UX plan.
- [x] **Phase 1: Backend Refactor for Dynamic Case Management**
    - [x] Integrated SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database.
    - [x] Defined a `Case` model for the database.
    - [x] Created database tables on application startup.
    - [x] Implemented a `case_service` for database interactions.
    - [x] Built `POST /upload` and `GET /` endpoints for cases.
    - [x] Tested new endpoints and confirmed functionality.

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Phase 2: Frontend Rebuild with Next.js & Tailwind CSS**
    - [ ] Bootstrap new Next.js application in `frontend` directory.
    - [ ] Create a new UI layout with Tailwind CSS.
    - [ ] Implement the new two-option upload page.
    - [ ] Implement the cases dashboard to list all cases.
    - [ ] Implement download logic for the comprehensive summary (pending backend endpoint).

## Future Tasks

- [ ] **Backend Enhancement**
    - [ ] Create a new endpoint (`/api/v1/cases/{id}/analysis`) to run the `CaseAnalyzer` service.
    - [ ] Ensure the new endpoint returns a comprehensive summary.
    - [ ] Modify the `analyze` button on the frontend to call this new endpoint.
- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging and error monitoring.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Frontend (New Plan: Next.js/Tailwind)

The goal is to build a modern, client-side rendered UI that communicates directly with the FastAPI backend.

1.  **Project Setup:**
    -   Use `create-next-app` to initialize the project with Tailwind CSS.
    -   Configure environment variables for the backend URL (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).
2.  **UI Components:**
    -   Create a main `Layout` component.
    -   Build a `Navbar` for navigation.
3.  **Upload Page (`/upload`):**
    -   Design a UI with two distinct upload options:
        1.  **Case Law Upload**: For single documents containing both ruling and pleadings. Sets `document_type` to `CASE_LAW`.
        2.  **Pleadings Upload**: For separate pleadings documents. Sets `document_type` to `PLEADINGS`.
    -   Implement API calls to `POST /api/v1/cases/upload`.
4.  **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`):**
    -   Fetch and display all cases from `GET /api/v1/cases/`.
    -   Display case status (`Uploaded`, `Processing`, `Completed`, `Failed`).
    -   Include a button to trigger analysis (will call the new backend endpoint when ready).
    -   Include a button to download the summary (will be enabled when analysis is complete).

- **React Frontend**: TypeScript with Material-UI/Ant Design
- **Async Processing**: All I/O operations are async for better performance
- **Caching System**: Multi-tier caching strategy
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Data Flow
1. Frontend User Input → API Request
2. FastAPI Endpoint → Service Layer
3. Service Layer → Existing Backend Services
4. Service Response → API Response
5. API Response → Frontend Rendering
6. Frontend → User Interaction

### Relevant Files

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- `backend/api/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `backend/api/routers/` - API route definitions
- `backend/api/models/` - Pydantic models for requests/responses
- `backend/api/dependencies/` - Dependency injection
- `backend/api/middleware/` - CORS and other middleware

#### Frontend (React)
- `frontend/src/components/` - React components
- `frontend/src/pages/` - Page components
- `frontend/src/services/` - API service functions
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `frontend/src/utils/` - Utility functions

#### Existing Backend Services (Integration)
- `backend/services/` - Existing service layer ✅
- `backend/models/` - Existing data models ✅
- `backend/utils/` - Existing utilities ✅
- `cache/` - Existing cache system ✅
- `data/` - Existing data storage ✅

## Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ Serp search integration with real Kenyan court cases
- ✅ GPT-4o analysis of search results
- ✅ PDF downloading with cache support
- ✅ PDF text extraction and processing
- ✅ Case analysis with litigation hop detection
- ✅ Caching system for avoiding re-processing
- ✅ End-to-end workflow execution
- ✅ Updated PRD with FastAPI and frontend architecture

### Planning Phase
- 🔄 FastAPI backend architecture planning
- 🔄 React frontend architecture planning
- 🔄 API endpoint design and specification
- 🔄 Frontend component structure planning

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Filtering logic needs improvement for appellate court detection
- ⚠️ PDF analysis performance could be optimized
- ⚠️ Some error handling edge cases need attention

## Next Steps

1. **Start with FastAPI Backend**: Begin with core FastAPI setup and Tier 1 endpoints
2. **Implement Search Integration**: Connect existing search services to API
3. **Add PDF Management**: Integrate existing PDF services with API
4. **Create Basic Frontend**: Start with search interface
5. **Iterative Development**: Build and test each tier incrementally

## Environment Configuration

- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **Virtual Environment**: `law_env/`
- **Key Dependencies**: openai, aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, PyPDF2, loguru, fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Material-UI/Ant Design
- **API Keys**: OpenAI API key, Serp API key (configured via .env)
- **Data Directories**: data/raw, data/processed, cache, results

## Best Starting Points

### For FastAPI Backend:
1. **Start with `/api/v1/cases/search`** - This leverages your existing SerpSearchService
2. **Then add `/api/v1/cases/download`** - Integrates your PDFDownloader service
3. **Follow with `/api/v1/cases/raw`** - Provides access to existing cached data

### For React Frontend:
1. **Start with Search Interface** - Most critical user-facing feature
2. **Then add Case Analysis Dashboard** - Core value proposition
3. **Follow with Export Interface** - Completes the user workflow

This approach allows you to build incrementally while leveraging your existing robust backend services.
