## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend (Completed)

The backend has been transitioned to a dynamic, database-driven system.

**Files Created/Modified in Phase 1:**
- `backend/database.py` - ✅
- `backend/models/case_models.py` - ✅
- `backend/services/case_service.py` - ✅
- `backend/api/routers/cases.py` - ✅
- `backend/api/main.py` - ✅
- `start_server.sh` - ✅

### Phase 2: Frontend (In Progress)

The goal is to build a new user interface that supports the dynamic backend functionality.

1.  **New Navigation & Layout:**
    -   Create a main `Layout.tsx` component with a persistent sidebar.
    -   Implement the sidebar with navigation links to the new pages.
    -   Update `App.tsx` to use the new layout and routing structure.
2.  **Dashboard Page:**
    -   Build a new dashboard page (`/dashboard`).
    -   Fetch and display the list of all cases from the `GET /api/cases` endpoint.
    -   Display cases in a table with status and action buttons.
3.  **Upload Page:**
    -   Build a new page (`/upload`) for file uploads.
    -   Implement a file uploader component that sends files to the `POST /api/cases/upload` endpoint.
4.  **Integrate Search:**
    -   Keep the existing search UI but update it to work with the new backend if necessary (TBD).

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture
- **Three-Tier API Design**: Raw Data, Analysis, Application layers
- **React Frontend**: TypeScript with Material-UI/Ant Design
- **Async Processing**: All I/O operations are async for better performance
- **Caching System**: Multi-tier caching strategy
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Data Flow
1. Frontend User Input → API Request
2. FastAPI Endpoint → Service Layer
3. Service Layer → Existing Backend Services
4. Service Response → API Response
5. API Response → Frontend Rendering
6. Frontend → User Interaction

### Relevant Files

#### Backend (FastAPI)
- `backend/api/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `backend/api/routers/` - API route definitions
- `backend/api/models/` - Pydantic models for requests/responses
- `backend/api/dependencies/` - Dependency injection
- `backend/api/middleware/` - CORS and other middleware

#### Frontend (React)
- `frontend/src/components/` - React components
- `frontend/src/pages/` - Page components
- `frontend/src/services/` - API service functions
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `frontend/src/utils/` - Utility functions

#### Existing Backend Services (Integration)
- `backend/services/` - Existing service layer ✅
- `backend/models/` - Existing data models ✅
- `backend/utils/` - Existing utilities ✅
- `cache/` - Existing cache system ✅
- `data/` - Existing data storage ✅

## Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ Serp search integration with real Kenyan court cases
- ✅ GPT-4o analysis of search results
- ✅ PDF downloading with cache support
- ✅ PDF text extraction and processing
- ✅ Case analysis with litigation hop detection
- ✅ Caching system for avoiding re-processing
- ✅ End-to-end workflow execution
- ✅ Updated PRD with FastAPI and frontend architecture

### Planning Phase
- 🔄 FastAPI backend architecture planning
- 🔄 React frontend architecture planning
- 🔄 API endpoint design and specification
- 🔄 Frontend component structure planning

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Filtering logic needs improvement for appellate court detection
- ⚠️ PDF analysis performance could be optimized
- ⚠️ Some error handling edge cases need attention

## Next Steps

1. **Start with FastAPI Backend**: Begin with core FastAPI setup and Tier 1 endpoints
2. **Implement Search Integration**: Connect existing search services to API
3. **Add PDF Management**: Integrate existing PDF services with API
4. **Create Basic Frontend**: Start with search interface
5. **Iterative Development**: Build and test each tier incrementally

## Environment Configuration

- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **Virtual Environment**: `law_env/`
- **Key Dependencies**: openai, aiohttp, beautifulsoup4, PyPDF2, loguru, fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Material-UI/Ant Design
- **API Keys**: OpenAI API key, Serp API key (configured via .env)
- **Data Directories**: data/raw, data/processed, cache, results

## Best Starting Points

### For FastAPI Backend:
1. **Start with `/api/v1/cases/search`** - This leverages your existing SerpSearchService
2. **Then add `/api/v1/cases/download`** - Integrates your PDFDownloader service
3. **Follow with `/api/v1/cases/raw`** - Provides access to existing cached data

### For React Frontend:
1. **Start with Search Interface** - Most critical user-facing feature
2. **Then add Case Analysis Dashboard** - Core value proposition
3. **Follow with Export Interface** - Completes the user workflow

This approach allows you to build incrementally while leveraging your existing robust backend services.
