Onsarigo (RM)\ndelivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010)\nJUDGEMENT\nINTRODUCTION\n1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the\nlower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st\nrespondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant’s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant’s driver\nor agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was\na passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense\ndenying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the\ndefendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time\nof the accident.\n2. Before considering the facts and the parties’ submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re-\nevaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and\ngiving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see  Selle v Associated\nMotor Boat Co.  [1968] EA 123 ).\n3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that\nwhen they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken\nto the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified\nthat he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/7\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the\nright shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur.\n5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui   Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but\nwas disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000/-. He produced the appellant’s filed list of documents in support of his\ntestimony.\n6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100% liable for the accident, awarded the 1st\nrespondent Kshs 800,000/- as general damages and Kshs 63,860/- as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court\nheld as follows;\n“The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle\nKTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November\n2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the\nowner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor\nvehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable\nway to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100%liable.”\n7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds:\n1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which\nshowed that;\na) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.\nb) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party.\nc) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it.\nd) The appellant was not in possession and/or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.\n2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant’s documents produced in evidence.\n5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant’s submissions dated\nand filed on 11th September 2015.\n6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities.\n7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive.\nSUBMISSIONS\n8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st\nrespondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/7\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nevidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior\nto the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli\n[2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the\nappellant’s case.\n9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the\nappellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out\nthat the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle.\nHe had also conveniently failed to testify.\n10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between\nthe appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the\nappellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both\nthe appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified.\n11. The appellant also challenged the trial court’s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000/= awarded as\ngeneral damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted\nthat a sum of Kshs. 500,000/= would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered.\n12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third\nparty and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at\nthe material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not\nmove from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant’s\nstature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated\nway of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take\nadvantage of its own mistake.\n13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of\ngeneral damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a\ncompounded fracture which was a very severe.\n14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in\nThika, Kiambu and Murang’a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the\nissues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal.\nANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION\n15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent’s contention that this court lacked\nterritorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent’s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have\njurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang’a. Order 47 Rule 10  of\nthe Civil ProcedureRules  provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in\nthe District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\"\n16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice,\nthe Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the\nHigh Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court.\nBut the converse is true.\n17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice.\nThe High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law.\nThat jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law.\n18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act,\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/7\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nthere are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and\nOthers, 1958 EA 375  which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil\nAppeal No. 287 of 2002)\n19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR,  had this\nto say on the matter;\n           “………… that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country\nsuch as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that\nsuits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and\ndetermination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is\nintended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite\nhearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which\nemphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits.”\n20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be\noveremphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a\ndistrict registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against\nunnecessary costs and inconvenience.\n21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire\nproceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to\ntransfer this appeal to the desired registry.\n22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court\nhad jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the\njurisdiction is dismissed.\n23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains\nto ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of\nKenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of  Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of\n2001 where Warsame J held as follows;\n“Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to\nthe defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show\nthat a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a\npublic document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the\nstandard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the\naccident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the\ndocumentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial\ncontained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact\ndenied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence.”\n24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was\nthe owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in\naccordance with Section 109  of the Evidence Act  which provides that, “ the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the\nperson who wishes the court to believe in its existence...”\n25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time\nthe accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995\nauthorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000/=. DW1 also\nproduced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000/= as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the\nmotor vehicle to her.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/7\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra),  Ignatius Makau Mutisya\nv Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another (supra) the copy of records\nobtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is\nindicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual\npossession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit.\n27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding\nthat the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent’s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the\nmaterial time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged.\n28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated\nthat the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he\nstated during close examination;\n “….. after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege”\n29. The 1st Respondent’s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search\ncertificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to\ndemonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The\nappellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the\nmotor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st\nRespondent’s case against the appellant.\n30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding\non liability.\n31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the\nevidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time.   This position is informed by the\nfact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle.\n32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd\nRespondent in the trial.   When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated;\n“I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party’s case.”\n33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no\nneed to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor\nvehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent’s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By\nletting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the\neffect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle.\n34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR\nwhere the Court of Appeal held;\n“We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles\nshowing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its\ncontents cannot be later denied. ” [Emphasis added]\n35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana& 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 & 156 of 2012\n[2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows;\n“14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/7\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nthen the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper\nadvertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the\nadvertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what\nthey purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of\nthe motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the\naccident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed\nas much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party\ninsurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take\nout insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that\ndefendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate\nconsidered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had\ndischarged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell\nthe plaintiffs.”\n36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown\nto have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as\nwell as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be\ndealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff’s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to\ntestify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant’s invitation to draw an\nadverse inference from his failure to do so.\n37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed\nthat the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error\nwhen making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would\nhave reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the\naccident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident.\n38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial\ncourt on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in\nsome material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ).\n39.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; .. after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38.

There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a.

The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; .. after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.

Onsarigo (RM)\ndelivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010)\nJUDGEMENT\nINTRODUCTION\n1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the\nlower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st\nrespondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant’s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant’s driver\nor agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was\na passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense\ndenying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the\ndefendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time\nof the accident.\n2. Before considering the facts and the parties’ submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re-\nevaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and\ngiving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see  Selle v Associated\nMotor Boat Co.  [1968] EA 123 ).\n3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that\nwhen they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken\nto the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified\nthat he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station\n4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the\nright shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur.\n5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui   Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but\nwas disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000/-. He produced the appellant’s filed list of documents in support of his\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/7\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\ntestimony.\n6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100% liable for the accident, awarded the 1st\nrespondent Kshs 800,000/- as general damages and Kshs 63,860/- as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court\nheld as follows;\n“The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle\nKTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November\n2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the\nowner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor\nvehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable\nway to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100%liable.”\n7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds:\n1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which\nshowed that;\na) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.\nb) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party.\nc) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it.\nd) The appellant was not in possession and/or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.\n2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant’s documents produced in evidence.\n5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant’s submissions dated\nand filed on 11th September 2015.\n6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities.\n7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive.\nSUBMISSIONS\n8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st\nrespondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary\nevidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior\nto the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli\n[2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the\nappellant’s case.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/7\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the\nappellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out\nthat the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle.\nHe had also conveniently failed to testify.\n10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between\nthe appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the\nappellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both\nthe appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified.\n11. The appellant also challenged the trial court’s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000/= awarded as\ngeneral damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted\nthat a sum of Kshs. 500,000/= would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered.\n12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third\nparty and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at\nthe material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not\nmove from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant’s\nstature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated\nway of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take\nadvantage of its own mistake.\n13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of\ngeneral damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a\ncompounded fracture which was a very severe.\n14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in\nThika, Kiambu and Murang’a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the\nissues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal.\nANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION\n15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent’s contention that this court lacked\nterritorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent’s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have\njurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang’a. Order 47 Rule 10  of\nthe Civil ProcedureRules  provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in\nthe District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\"\n16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice,\nthe Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the\nHigh Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court.\nBut the converse is true.\n17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice.\nThe High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law.\nThat jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law.\n18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act,\nthere are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and\nOthers, 1958 EA 375  which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil\nAppeal No. 287 of 2002)\n19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR,  had this\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/7\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nto say on the matter;\n           “………… that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country\nsuch as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that\nsuits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and\ndetermination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is\nintended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite\nhearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which\nemphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits.”\n20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be\noveremphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a\ndistrict registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against\nunnecessary costs and inconvenience.\n21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire\nproceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to\ntransfer this appeal to the desired registry.\n22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court\nhad jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the\njurisdiction is dismissed.\n23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains\nto ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of\nKenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of  Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of\n2001 where Warsame J held as follows;\n“Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to\nthe defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show\nthat a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a\npublic document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the\nstandard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the\naccident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the\ndocumentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial\ncontained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact\ndenied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence.”\n24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was\nthe owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in\naccordance with Section 109  of the Evidence Act  which provides that, “ the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the\nperson who wishes the court to believe in its existence....”\n25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time\nthe accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995\nauthorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000/=. DW1 also\nproduced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000/= as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the\nmotor vehicle to her.\n26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra),  Ignatius Makau Mutisya\nv Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another (supra) the copy of records\nobtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is\nindicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual\npossession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/7\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding\nthat the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent’s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the\nmaterial time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged.\n28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated\nthat the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he\nstated during close examination;\n “…... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege”\n29. The 1st Respondent’s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search\ncertificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to\ndemonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The\nappellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the\nmotor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st\nRespondent’s case against the appellant.\n30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding\non liability.\n31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the\nevidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time.   This position is informed by the\nfact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle.\n32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd\nRespondent in the trial.   When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated;\n“I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party’s case.”\n33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no\nneed to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor\nvehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent’s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By\nletting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the\neffect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle.\n34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR\nwhere the Court of Appeal held;\n“We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles\nshowing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its\ncontents cannot be later denied. ” [Emphasis added]\n35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana& 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 & 156 of 2012\n[2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows;\n“14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was\nthen the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper\nadvertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the\nadvertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what\nthey purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of\nthe motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the\naccident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/7\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nas much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party\ninsurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take\nout insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that\ndefendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate\nconsidered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had\ndischarged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell\nthe plaintiffs.”\n36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown\nto have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as\nwell as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be\ndealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff’s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to\ntestify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant’s invitation to draw an\nadverse inference from his failure to do so.\n37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed\nthat the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error\nwhen making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would\nhave reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the\naccident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident.\n38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial\ncourt on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in\nsome material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ).\n39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the\nright femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs.\n800,000/= would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by\nthe parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent’s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had\nbeen assessed at 20%. I find no reason to interfere with the trial court’s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs.\n800,000/= made for general damages.\n40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710/= which was the sum pleaded and proved.\n41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows;\na. The trial court’s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100% against the 2nd respondent;\nb. The trial court’s award of general damages is upheld;\nc. The trial court’s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710/=\nd. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.\nDated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th  day of  May, 2020.\nA. K.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence.... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; ... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents. Dated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th day of May, 2020. A. K.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence.... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; ... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents. Dated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th day of May, 2020. A. K.

No. 2410 of 1999)\n****************\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nIntroduction.\nThe appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates  filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410\nof 1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited.  The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day\nof December, 1999. The appellant’s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the\nappellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur\nWilliam Ogwayo.  On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on\nor about the 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of\nwhich, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William\nOgwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money.\nBy reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and\nreputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent\nGeneral damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and\ninterests on the above.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/13\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying\nthe entire claim.\nThereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of\nMay, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There\nfollowed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng  Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the\nonly witnesses.\nJudgment of the High Court.\nParties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J  in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February,\n2004 delivered himself inter alia thus:-\n“As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of\ndamages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out\nnow in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million.\nThere is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the\ncosts of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment.”\nGrounds of appeal\nThe appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal.\nThese are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:-\n(1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special\nclearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. \n(2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff’s\ncheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a\ncheque. \n(3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence\nthat the dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. \n(4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. \n(5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not\ndate of judgment. \n(6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant’s Advocates. \n(7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely\ninjuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. \n(8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence\nbefore him. \nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/13\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n(9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the\nfacts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff.” \n(10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting\norder of that judgment. \nThe appellant’s submissions\nThe appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge’s findings on the grounds that the learned trial\nJudge fell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57  of the\nBills of Exchange Act Cap 27  Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for\nbreach of contract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii)\nwhen he erroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of\nsubstantial damages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters\nthat the cheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages\nwhich had been pleaded and proved.\nRespondent’s submissions.\nIn response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge’s decision and dismiss the\nappellant’s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors\nfavouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and\nalso overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in\nunequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the\nlibel reached only one person, the appellant’s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect\nthe integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case.\nTurning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent’s arguments that these fell\nwithin the threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the\nguiding principle that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court’s discretion.\nThe respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the\naward of damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured\ncheque of Kshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the\ncountry with the said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of\nthe said cheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the\ndishonoured cheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section\n57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27  laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages;\nthat the appellant was not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither\npleaded nor specifically proved these.\nAs for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the\nappellant’s oral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30% because it was also\nnot pleaded in the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have\nbeen manifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on\ndamages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/13\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to\nhim as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to\nhis reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they\nwere indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge.\nThe Appellant’s Authorities.\nThe appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich  Building Society\n[1964] 4 ALLER 119  for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial\nrather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque\nbeing wrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1\nALL ER 316  for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where\nthere was no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in\ninstances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to\nmeet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and  another versus Barclays Bank limited\n[1936] 1 ALL ER 653  for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a\ndebt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the\ndefendant’s hands.\nRespondent’s Authorities.\nThe respondent on the other hand   relied on the legal text of Ellinger’s Modern Banking Law\nFourth Edition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page\n461 for the proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the\nbank’s part and in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any\ncarelessly composed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as\ndefamation provided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of \nBanking Twelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit\nof a customer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a\ncustomer will be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to\nhis reputation.\nTurning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus  West Minister\nBank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577  for the proposition that:\n“A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful\ndishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as\nspecial damages”; the decision in the case of  Mbogo and another versus  Shah [1968] EA 93  for the\nproposition that “ a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a\njudge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a\nwrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly\nwrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice.”\nThe decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67.  At page 75\nthis Court made observation thus:-\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/13\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n“To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not\nnecessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite\nmodest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive.\n.....\nIt is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made,\nbut again they must not be excessive...”\nOn the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:-\n“A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial  damages for the wrongful\ndishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a\nspecial damage.....”\nLastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim & another versus Kikaua [1988]  KLR 534. In this\ncase, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of  Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu\n[1965] EA 592  and went on to hold inter alia that:-\n“According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of\nassessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant’s liability\nto pay does arise.”\nThe Mandate of the Court.\nThis is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the\nrecord before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the\ncase of Sumaria & Another versus Allied Industries Limited  [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being\nthat in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a\nfinding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of\nthe evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching\nthe finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi & another [2007] 2KLR 159  .\nWe have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re-\nevaluated and re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following\ndetermination in the appellant’s complaints;\nDetermination of issue No.1\nOn the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to\nspecifically mention the respondent’s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the\nrespondent’s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It\nwas in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no\nobligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the\nadmission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed.\nDetermination of issue No.2\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/13\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi\nOchieng Nyamogo  on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:-\n“As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to\npay the money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland.\n...\nReceived two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized\neventually we paid our client...”\nWhen cross examined by Mr. Majanja,  PW1 had this response to make:-\n“The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We\npaid Mr. Ogwayo the money.”\nMr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had\nthis to say:-\n“I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward\ntransmission to me....\nFrom the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On\nthe above representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the\ncheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was\nhowever no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the\nlearned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the\nappellant’s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured.\nWe find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed.\nDetermination of issue No.3\nThere was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57  of the Bills of\nExchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant’s plaint.\nThe relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;-\n“57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be\nliquidated damages shall be as follows....\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/13\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nBy reason of the words “ shall be deemed to be liquidated”  denotes that any party wishing to avail itself\nof that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically\npleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it.\nThere was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on\naccount of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57  of the Bill\nof Exchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1’s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose\nfrom the conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of\n30/3/1999, that  Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan & Stratton had written to PW1.\nThe content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant’s testimony in court\nwhen he made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant\nshould be based on the value of the dishonoured cheque.\nThe framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his\ndiscretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated\nthis as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no\nparticularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms.\nIn the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when\nassessing damages payable herein.\nDetermination of issue No.4\nWith regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant’s prayer was for.\n“(e) Costs and interest on the above.”\n“And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment”\nSection 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides:\n26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree\norder interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum\nadjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged\non such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such\nrate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the\ndecree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit.\n2 .......”\nIt was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of\ninterest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position\nin law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The\npredecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited\n[1956] Volume XXII  EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president  inter alia had this to observe at page 140\nparagraph 3:-\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7/13\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n“The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the\npoints in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet\nand prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief\nnot founded on the pleadings will not be given...”\nAfter citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris  [1930] 1.K.B. 682-  he\nadded the following:-\n“Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues\nthey must be placed on the record by amendment...”\nThis position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the\ncase of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476.  Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph\n9-11 had this to say:-\n“On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been\npleaded, the attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in\nIndia. In East Africa the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its\ndecision on an unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the\nunpleaded issue has in fact been left to the court for decision...”\nPW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it\nthat this request removed the appellant’s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings\nand then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court’s adjudication by virtue of these\nhaving been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is\nwhether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1’s request for interest at commercial rate. He was\nnot.\nIn the case of Salim & another versus Kikava (supra)  this Court revisited and confirmed the\nprovisions of section 26  of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large\nstarts running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why\nthe learned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on\ndamages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand.\nDetermination of issue number 5.\nThe learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the\nauthorities cites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus  Bank of Baroda\n(supra) and the decision in  Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building  Society (supra).\nThe decision in Kpohror (supra)  which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on\nenunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that “a person who is not a trader is not entitled to\nrecover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has\nsuffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed\nthe defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a\nmatter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett & another case  (supra) it simply stated\ninter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8/13\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nfunds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the\ndrawer; the words “ refer to drawer ” in the circumstances were held not to be “ a libel.”\nThe learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely\ndamages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head\nwhere the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been\noccasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a\nspecial damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case  (supra) was distinguished by the learned\nJudge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00  had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial\nJudge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo.\nThe funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr.\nOgwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship\nwith the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant\nafter the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis\nof the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant\ncould only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None\nof the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the\nappellant’s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra),  the holding is inter alia that “ word refer to\ndrawer”, does not amount to libel”. In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge’s discounting\nof the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him.\nDetermination of issue No.6\nThe complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award\nof nominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together.\nDetermination of issue No.7\nThis relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge’s failure to make provision for an award of\nspecial damages. Shiraku case (supra)  is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as\na special damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716  for the proposition that\nspecial damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do\nso.\nDetermination of issue number 8.\nThe head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of\ncontract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00.\nThe principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the\nsuperior court’s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden\npath. Sir Charles New Bold  P. in the case of  Mbogo & another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96\nparagraph G-H had this to say:-\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9/13\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n“For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the\nexercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his\ndiscretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or\nunless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the\nexercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice”\nSee also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of  Butler versus\nButler [1984] KLR 225  wherein it was held inter alia that:-\n“The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an\nappellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong\nprinciples or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he\nhas taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at\na wrong decision.”\nIn addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court’s attention to\nthe provisions of section 16A (1)  of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:-\n“In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount\nas it may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death,\nthe amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect\nof an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount\nassessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings”\nThe appellant’s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters\naverred to therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of\nbusiness.\nIn paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:-\n“11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant’s actions were\ncalculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade.\n12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered\ngeneral loss on their said business. \n13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious\npublication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in\nits credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt” \nAll the above averments indicate that the appellant’s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed\nabove indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage.\nBy this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer\nOgwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the\nappellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove\nthe actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the\nappellant’s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10/13\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nAs for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank  Limited\n[1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that\n“The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal  damages in respect of the\nwrongful dishonor of a cheque by her bank.”\nGrabbe JA.    in the case of  Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484  at\npage 487 paragraph G-I had this to say:-\n“Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like\nreal damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a\nlegal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to\nthe verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal\ndamage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what\nis called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for\nthe use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it\ncertainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are\nnecessarily nominal damages.\nIn the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B.  494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at\nP.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in\npoint of quantity” and as a “mere peg on which to hang costs.”\nIn Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242,  this Court held inter alia\nthat where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon\nsome conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a\nchance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages.\nApplying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the\nappellant’s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because\nthe appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his\nprofessional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion\non their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich\nBuilding Society (supra)  wherein it was held inter alia that:\n“A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal  damages in\ncontract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly\ndishonoured by his bank”; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages\nwere awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates.\nThey were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a\ncaveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were\ninvolved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no\nquarrel with the appellant’s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of\nadvocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the\nreputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the\nrespondent and the appellant’s then affected client.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11/13\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been\nsomething beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also\nrelated to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 .\nIn the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for\ninjurious falsehood but set aside the award of  Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an\naward of Kshs.500, 000.00  as damages for breach of contract.

No. 2410 of 1999) JUDGMENT OF THE COURT Introduction. The appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410 of 1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited. The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day of December, 1999. The appellant s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo. On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on or about the 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying the entire claim. Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of May, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Judgment of the High Court. Parties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February, 2004 delivered himself inter alia thus:- As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Grounds of appeal The appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal. These are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:- (1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special clearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. (2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff s cheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a cheque. (3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence that the dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. (4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. (5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not date of judgment. (6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant s Advocates. (7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely injuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. (8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence before him. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR (9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff. (10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting order of that judgment. The appellant s submissions The appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge s findings on the grounds that the learned trial Judge fell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for breach of contract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii) when he erroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of substantial damages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters that the cheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages which had been pleaded and proved. Respondent s submissions. In response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge s decision and dismiss the appellant s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors favouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and also overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in unequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the libel reached only one person, the appellant s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect the integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case. Turning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent s arguments that these fell within the threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the guiding principle that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court s discretion. The respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the award of damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured cheque of Kshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the country with the said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of the said cheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the dishonoured cheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages; that the appellant was not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither pleaded nor specifically proved these. As for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the appellant s oral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30 because it was also not pleaded in the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have been manifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on damages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to him as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to his reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they were indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge. The Appellant s Authorities. The appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society [1964] 4 ALLER 119 for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1 ALL ER 316 for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where there was no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in instances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to meet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and another versus Barclays Bank limited [1936] 1 ALL ER 653 for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the defendant s hands. Respondent s Authorities. The respondent on the other hand relied on the legal text of Ellinger s Modern Banking Law Fourth Edition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page 461 for the proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the bank s part and in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any carelessly composed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as defamation provided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of Banking Twelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit of a customer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a customer will be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to his reputation. Turning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577 for the proposition that: A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages ; the decision in the case of Mbogo and another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 for the proposition that a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice. The decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67. At page 75 this Court made observation thus:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not necessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite modest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive. ..... It is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made, but again they must not be excessive... On the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:- A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a special damage..... Lastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim another versus Kikaua [1988] KLR 534. In this case, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu [1965] EA 592 and went on to hold inter alia that:- According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of assessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant s liability to pay does arise. The Mandate of the Court. This is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the record before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the case of Sumaria Another versus Allied Industries Limited [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being that in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a finding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of the evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching the finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi another [2007] 2KLR 159 . We have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re- evaluated and re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following determination in the appellant s complaints; Determination of issue No.1 On the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed. Determination of issue No.2 http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:- As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to pay the money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland. ... Received two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized eventually we paid our client... When cross examined by Mr. Majanja, PW1 had this response to make:- The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We paid Mr. Ogwayo the money. Mr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had this to say:- I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward transmission to me.... From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the above representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the learned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. We find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed. Determination of issue No.3 There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. The relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;- 57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages shall be as follows.... http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By reason of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated denotes that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1 s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose from the conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of 30 3 1999, that Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan Stratton had written to PW1. The content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant s testimony in court when he made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant should be based on the value of the dishonoured cheque. The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated this as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when assessing damages payable herein. Determination of issue No.4 With regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant s prayer was for. (e) Costs and interest on the above. And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides: 26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree order interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such rate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit. 2 ....... It was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The predecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited [1956] Volume XXII EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president inter alia had this to observe at page 140 paragraph 3:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given... After citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris [1930] 1.K.B. 682- he added the following:- Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by amendment... This position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the case of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476. Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph 9-11 had this to say:- On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been pleaded, the attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in India. In East Africa the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its decision on an unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the unpleaded issue has in fact been left to the court for decision... PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it that this request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of these having been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is whether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. He was not. In the case of Salim another versus Kikava (supra) this Court revisited and confirmed the provisions of section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large starts running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why the learned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand. Determination of issue number 5. The learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the authorities cites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus Bank of Baroda (supra) and the decision in Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building Society (supra). The decision in Kpohror (supra) which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on enunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that a person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed the defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a matter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett another case (supra) it simply stated inter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR funds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the drawer; the words refer to drawer in the circumstances were held not to be a libel. The learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head where the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a special damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case (supra) was distinguished by the learned Judge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00 had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial Judge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr. Ogwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the appellant s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra), the holding is inter alia that word refer to drawer , does not amount to libel . In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge s discounting of the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. Determination of issue No.6 The complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award of nominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together. Determination of issue No.7 This relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge s failure to make provision for an award of special damages. Shiraku case (supra) is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as a special damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716 for the proposition that special damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. Determination of issue number 8. The head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of contract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00. The principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the superior court s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden path. Sir Charles New Bold P. in the case of Mbogo another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96 paragraph G-H had this to say:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice See also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of Butler versus Butler [1984] KLR 225 wherein it was held inter alia that:- The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an appellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong principles or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he has taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at a wrong decision. In addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court s attention to the provisions of section 16A (1) of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:- In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount as it may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death, the amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount assessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings The appellant s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters averred to therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:- 11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant s actions were calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade. 12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered general loss on their said business. 13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious publication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in its credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt All the above averments indicate that the appellant s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed above indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. By this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer Ogwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR As for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal damages in respect of the wrongful dishonor of a cheque by her bank. Grabbe JA. in the case of Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484 at page 487 paragraph G-I had this to say:- Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. In the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B. 494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at P.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. In Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242, this Court held inter alia that where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. Applying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the appellant s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society (supra) wherein it was held inter alia that: A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank ; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages were awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a caveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 . In the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for injurious falsehood but set aside the award of Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract. The appellant will have half the costs of this appeal. Dated and Delivered at Nairobi this 8th day of May, 2015. R.N. NAMBUYE .................................. JUDGE OF APPEAL P.O.

No. 2410 of 1999) JUDGMENT OF THE COURT Introduction. The appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410 of 1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited. The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day of December, 1999. The appellant s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo. On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on or about the 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying the entire claim. Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of May, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Judgment of the High Court. Parties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February, 2004 delivered himself inter alia thus:- As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Grounds of appeal The appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal. These are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:- (1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special clearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. (2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff s cheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a cheque. (3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence that the dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. (4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. (5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not date of judgment. (6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant s Advocates. (7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely injuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. (8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence before him. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR (9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff. (10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting order of that judgment. The appellant s submissions The appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge s findings on the grounds that the learned trial Judge fell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for breach of contract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii) when he erroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of substantial damages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters that the cheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages which had been pleaded and proved. Respondent s submissions. In response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge s decision and dismiss the appellant s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors favouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and also overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in unequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the libel reached only one person, the appellant s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect the integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case. Turning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent s arguments that these fell within the threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the guiding principle that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court s discretion. The respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the award of damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured cheque of Kshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the country with the said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of the said cheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the dishonoured cheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages; that the appellant was not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither pleaded nor specifically proved these. As for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the appellant s oral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30 because it was also not pleaded in the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have been manifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on damages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to him as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to his reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they were indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge. The Appellant s Authorities. The appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society [1964] 4 ALLER 119 for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1 ALL ER 316 for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where there was no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in instances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to meet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and another versus Barclays Bank limited [1936] 1 ALL ER 653 for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the defendant s hands. Respondent s Authorities. The respondent on the other hand relied on the legal text of Ellinger s Modern Banking Law Fourth Edition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page 461 for the proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the bank s part and in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any carelessly composed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as defamation provided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of Banking Twelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit of a customer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a customer will be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to his reputation. Turning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577 for the proposition that: A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages ; the decision in the case of Mbogo and another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 for the proposition that a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice. The decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67. At page 75 this Court made observation thus:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not necessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite modest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive. ..... It is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made, but again they must not be excessive... On the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:- A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a special damage..... Lastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim another versus Kikaua [1988] KLR 534. In this case, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu [1965] EA 592 and went on to hold inter alia that:- According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of assessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant s liability to pay does arise. The Mandate of the Court. This is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the record before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the case of Sumaria Another versus Allied Industries Limited [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being that in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a finding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of the evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching the finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi another [2007] 2KLR 159 . We have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re- evaluated and re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following determination in the appellant s complaints; Determination of issue No.1 On the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed. Determination of issue No.2 http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:- As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to pay the money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland. ... Received two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized eventually we paid our client... When cross examined by Mr. Majanja, PW1 had this response to make:- The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We paid Mr. Ogwayo the money. Mr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had this to say:- I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward transmission to me.... From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the above representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the learned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. We find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed. Determination of issue No.3 There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. The relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;- 57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages shall be as follows.... http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By reason of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated denotes that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1 s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose from the conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of 30 3 1999, that Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan Stratton had written to PW1. The content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant s testimony in court when he made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant should be based on the value of the dishonoured cheque. The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated this as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when assessing damages payable herein. Determination of issue No.4 With regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant s prayer was for. (e) Costs and interest on the above. And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides: 26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree order interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such rate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit. 2 ....... It was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The predecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited [1956] Volume XXII EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president inter alia had this to observe at page 140 paragraph 3:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given... After citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris [1930] 1.K.B. 682- he added the following:- Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by amendment... This position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the case of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476. Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph 9-11 had this to say:- On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been pleaded, the attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in India. In East Africa the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its decision on an unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the unpleaded issue has in fact been left to the court for decision... PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it that this request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of these having been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is whether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. He was not. In the case of Salim another versus Kikava (supra) this Court revisited and confirmed the provisions of section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large starts running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why the learned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand. Determination of issue number 5. The learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the authorities cites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus Bank of Baroda (supra) and the decision in Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building Society (supra). The decision in Kpohror (supra) which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on enunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that a person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed the defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a matter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett another case (supra) it simply stated inter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR funds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the drawer; the words refer to drawer in the circumstances were held not to be a libel. The learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head where the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a special damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case (supra) was distinguished by the learned Judge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00 had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial Judge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr. Ogwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the appellant s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra), the holding is inter alia that word refer to drawer , does not amount to libel . In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge s discounting of the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. Determination of issue No.6 The complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award of nominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together. Determination of issue No.7 This relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge s failure to make provision for an award of special damages. Shiraku case (supra) is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as a special damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716 for the proposition that special damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. Determination of issue number 8. The head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of contract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00. The principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the superior court s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden path. Sir Charles New Bold P. in the case of Mbogo another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96 paragraph G-H had this to say:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice See also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of Butler versus Butler [1984] KLR 225 wherein it was held inter alia that:- The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an appellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong principles or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he has taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at a wrong decision. In addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court s attention to the provisions of section 16A (1) of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:- In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount as it may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death, the amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount assessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings The appellant s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters averred to therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:- 11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant s actions were calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade. 12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered general loss on their said business. 13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious publication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in its credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt All the above averments indicate that the appellant s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed above indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. By this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer Ogwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR As for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal damages in respect of the wrongful dishonor of a cheque by her bank. Grabbe JA. in the case of Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484 at page 487 paragraph G-I had this to say:- Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. In the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B. 494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at P.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. In Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242, this Court held inter alia that where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. Applying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the appellant s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society (supra) wherein it was held inter alia that: A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank ; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages were awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a caveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 13 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 . In the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for injurious falsehood but set aside the award of Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract. The appellant will have half the costs of this appeal. Dated and Delivered at Nairobi this 8th day of May, 2015. R.N. NAMBUYE .................................. JUDGE OF APPEAL P.O.

Onsarigo (RM)\ndelivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010)\nJUDGEMENT\nINTRODUCTION\n1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the\nlower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st\nrespondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant’s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant’s driver\nor agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was\na passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense\ndenying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the\ndefendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time\nof the accident.\n2. Before considering the facts and the parties’ submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re-\nevaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and\ngiving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see  Selle v Associated\nMotor Boat Co.  [1968] EA 123 ).\n3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that\nwhen they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken\nto the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified\nthat he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station\n4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the\nright shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur.\n5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui   Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but\nwas disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000/-. He produced the appellant’s filed list of documents in support of his\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/7\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\ntestimony.\n6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100% liable for the accident, awarded the 1st\nrespondent Kshs 800,000/- as general damages and Kshs 63,860/- as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court\nheld as follows;\n“The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle\nKTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November\n2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the\nowner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor\nvehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable\nway to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100%liable.”\n7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds:\n1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which\nshowed that;\na) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.\nb) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party.\nc) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it.\nd) The appellant was not in possession and/or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.\n2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant’s documents produced in evidence.\n5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant’s submissions dated\nand filed on 11th September 2015.\n6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities.\n7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive.\nSUBMISSIONS\n8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st\nrespondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary\nevidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior\nto the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli\n[2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the\nappellant’s case.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/7\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the\nappellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out\nthat the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle.\nHe had also conveniently failed to testify.\n10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between\nthe appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the\nappellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both\nthe appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified.\n11. The appellant also challenged the trial court’s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000/= awarded as\ngeneral damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted\nthat a sum of Kshs. 500,000/= would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered.\n12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third\nparty and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at\nthe material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not\nmove from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant’s\nstature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated\nway of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take\nadvantage of its own mistake.\n13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of\ngeneral damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a\ncompounded fracture which was a very severe.\n14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in\nThika, Kiambu and Murang’a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the\nissues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal.\nANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION\n15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent’s contention that this court lacked\nterritorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent’s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have\njurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang’a. Order 47 Rule 10  of\nthe Civil ProcedureRules  provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in\nthe District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\"\n16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice,\nthe Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the\nHigh Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court.\nBut the converse is true.\n17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice.\nThe High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law.\nThat jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law.\n18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act,\nthere are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and\nOthers, 1958 EA 375  which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil\nAppeal No. 287 of 2002)\n19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR,  had this\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/7\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nto say on the matter;\n           “………… that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country\nsuch as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that\nsuits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and\ndetermination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is\nintended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite\nhearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which\nemphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits.”\n20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be\noveremphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a\ndistrict registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against\nunnecessary costs and inconvenience.\n21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire\nproceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to\ntransfer this appeal to the desired registry.\n22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court\nhad jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the\njurisdiction is dismissed.\n23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains\nto ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of\nKenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of  Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of\n2001 where Warsame J held as follows;\n“Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to\nthe defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show\nthat a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a\npublic document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the\nstandard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the\naccident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the\ndocumentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial\ncontained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact\ndenied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence.”\n24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was\nthe owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in\naccordance with Section 109  of the Evidence Act  which provides that, “ the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the\nperson who wishes the court to believe in its existence....”\n25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time\nthe accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995\nauthorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000/=. DW1 also\nproduced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000/= as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the\nmotor vehicle to her.\n26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra),  Ignatius Makau Mutisya\nv Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another (supra) the copy of records\nobtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is\nindicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual\npossession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/7\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding\nthat the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent’s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the\nmaterial time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged.\n28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated\nthat the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he\nstated during close examination;\n “…... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege”\n29. The 1st Respondent’s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search\ncertificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to\ndemonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The\nappellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the\nmotor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st\nRespondent’s case against the appellant.\n30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding\non liability.\n31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the\nevidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time.   This position is informed by the\nfact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle.\n32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd\nRespondent in the trial.   When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated;\n“I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party’s case.”\n33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no\nneed to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor\nvehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent’s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By\nletting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the\neffect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle.\n34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR\nwhere the Court of Appeal held;\n“We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles\nshowing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its\ncontents cannot be later denied. ” [Emphasis added]\n35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana& 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 & 156 of 2012\n[2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows;\n“14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was\nthen the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper\nadvertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the\nadvertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what\nthey purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of\nthe motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the\naccident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/7\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nas much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party\ninsurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take\nout insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that\ndefendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate\nconsidered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had\ndischarged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell\nthe plaintiffs.”\n36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown\nto have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as\nwell as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be\ndealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff’s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to\ntestify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant’s invitation to draw an\nadverse inference from his failure to do so.\n37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed\nthat the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error\nwhen making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would\nhave reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the\naccident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident.\n38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial\ncourt on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in\nsome material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ).\n39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the\nright femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs.\n800,000/= would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by\nthe parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent’s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had\nbeen assessed at 20%. I find no reason to interfere with the trial court’s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs.\n800,000/= made for general damages.\n40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710/= which was the sum pleaded and proved.\n41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows;\na. The trial court’s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100% against the 2nd respondent;\nb. The trial court’s award of general damages is upheld;\nc. The trial court’s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710/=\nd. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.\nDated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th  day of  May, 2020.\nA. K.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence.... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; ... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents. Dated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th day of May, 2020. A. K.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence.... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; ... after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents. Dated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th day of May, 2020. A. K.

M. Mbati (Mrs.) delivered on the 21st\nFebruary, 2018 in Nairobi Children’s Case No. 698 of 2017 )\nJUDGMENT\n1. In a judgment dated 21st February, 2018 the Children Court at Nairobi in Case No. 698 of 2017 made orders directing that the\ndefendant pay in the first instance Kshs. 132,500/= towards the school fees needs of the plaintiff and that the mother do provide for\nall other school related expenses because parental responsibility is shared.\n2. Aggrieved by the decision, the defendant, who is the Appellant herein, approached the court by way of a memorandum of appeal\ndated 27th February, 2019 and filed on 20th June, 2018. The Appellant is asking the court to set aside the judgment and order of the\nChildren’s Court given on 21st February, 2018, and condemn the Respondent to pay the costs of this appeal.\n3. The Appellant advanced twelve (12) grounds of appeal the gist of which is that the honorable learned magistrate erred in law and\nin fact by allowing the suit filed by the Respondent for extension of parental responsibility whereas:\n1. The Respondent had confirmed during the hearing of the matter that the admission letter to East African Institute of Certified\nStudies, Nairobi produced as an exhibit in the case had lapsed and her place in the said college was no longer available.\n2. The Respondent had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability as expected in civil proceedings as she failed to produce\nher Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) to confirm that parental responsibility could be extended beyond eighteen\n(18) years by virtue of her qualification for admission to an institution of higher learning.\n3. It was evident from the Appellant’s net salary as exhibited in his pay slip that he could not afford to pay Kshs. 132,500/= towards\nthe Respondent’s college fees. Further that no evidence was presented to support the holding that even though the Appellant was\nstraining financially, he had other alternative sources of income to support the Respondent’s school needs.\n4. The Respondent had failed to demonstrate the special circumstances envisaged under section 28(1)  of the Children Act  with\nregard to the welfare of the child to warrant an order for extension of parental responsibility. Instead, the learned magistrate\nmisconstrued the law and held that regardless of the circumstances, once paternity is proved, extension of parental responsibility\nwould be a matter of natural course.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/6\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\n5. The Respondent has been out of school for four (4) years and is engaged in personal income generating undertakings, modeling\nand marketing, which she admitted to during her evidence in court.\n6. The Respondent’s mother had elected to disown the Appellant as admitted by the Respondent in her evidence and the Appellant\ntherefore organized his life and financial needs as circumstances would dictate, including acquisition of loans. That there is\ntherefore nothing sinister about the said loans because it is the Respondent who elected to sit on her rights.\n4. The appeal came up for directions on 24th January, 2019 where upon application by counsel for the Respondent the court directed\nthat the appeal be disposed of by way of written submissions. The matter had initially been referred to mediation but the parties\nfailed to reach a settlement as indicated in the Mediator’s Report dated 6th November, 2018.\n5. Learned Counsel Mr. Sumba filed written submissions dated 4th February, 2019 on behalf of the Appellant in which he reiterated\nthe grounds of the appeal and asked the court to allow the appeal in the terms prayed. Counsel urged that extension of parental\nresponsibility cannot be conferred to the Respondent without proof that she qualified to join an institution of higher learning.\nFurther that the Appellant’s resources are not sufficient to cater for his five (5) children and still pay for the Respondent’s college\nfees.\n6. Mr. Sumba asserted that the Respondent’s application in the Children’s Court was premised on section 28(1) of the Children\nAct which required that the Respondent demonstrate exceptional circumstances for parental responsibility to be extended but this\nwas not discharged. Counsel stated that the Respondent failed to exhibit a certificate for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education\nto demonstrate that she qualified to join college. Further that she had been out of school for a period of four (4) years and was in\ngainful employment. That in any event, the copy of the letter of admission had already lapsed even at the time the court held that\nfees be paid.\n7. In opposition, learned counsel Mr. Seth Ojienda filed written submissions dated 25th March, 2019 on behalf of the Respondent in\nwhich he submitted that it is in the best interest of the of the Respondent that the court sustain the lower court judgment and decree.\n8. It is Mr. Ojienda’s submission that the Respondent approached the Children’s Court seeking extension of parental responsibility\nagainst the Appellant since she had secured admission to pursue a diploma in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of\nCertified Studies but could not raise the fees of Kshs. 132,500/=. This prompted her to file the application since the Appellant, her\nbiological father, had the means to pay for her tertiary education.\n9. Mr. Ojienda submitted that parental responsibility is automatic and self-activating on parents upon the birth of a child and fathers\ncannot have the discretion of either rejecting or accepting that responsibility. That the fact that the Appellant failed to participate in\nthe general upbringing of the Respondent does not absolve him from exercising parental responsibility over her.\n10. Counsel asserted that section 28  of the Children Act provides that parental responsibility in respect of a child beyond the age of\neighteen years can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That\nsection 91  of the Children Act further provides for circumstances under which a person who is not a child can apply to the court for\na maintenance order.\n11. Mr. Ojienda submitted that the  Children Act  defines education to mean the giving of intellectual, moral, spiritual instruction or\nother training to a child. Counsel asserted that basic education is more than just learning how to read, write and calculate. It\nencompasses the broadest possible sense of learning at any stage of life and it is not confined to childhood and formative years.\nCounsel stated that the court has power to extend the right to education to a child of over eighteen (18) years if the court is satisfied\nupon application or on its own motion that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That in the instant\ncase, the special circumstance was that the Respondent required the Applicant to pay for her college fees.\n12. Counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of the Kenyan education system where a child starts school at the age of 6 years\nand remains reliant upon their parents for school fees, university or college fees beyond the age of eighteen (18) years. That it is the\nRespondent’s desperation to pursue higher education that made her file the suit before the lower court.\n13. It is Mr. Ojienda’s submission that even though the Respondent is a child born out of wedlock, Article 53  of the Constitution\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/6\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\nand the Children Act provide for the principles of equality and non-discrimination of legimate and illegitimate children. Counsel\nasserted that the Appellant has children from his current marriage for whom he is able and willing to provide for including payment\nof school fees for higher education.\n14. Mr. Ojienda noted that the Appellant has a daughter one MDA who is pursuing an undergraduate program in Education (Arts) at\n[Particulars withheld] University for whom he pays a total of one hundred and twenty six thousand shillings (Kshs. 126,000/=) per\nacademic year. That the Respondent’s reluctance to cater for the Respondent’s school fees to pursue a diploma in journalism\ntherefore amounts to discrimination. Counsel urged that the Appellant being able to afford school fees for his children within the\nmarriage set up is compelled by law to provide for the Respondent albeit born out of wedlock.\n15. The court has considered the grounds of appeal, the various authorities referred to by both counsels on record and their rival\narguments to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the orders for extension of parental\nresponsibility against the Appellant. This court is alive to the fact that it did not hear the witnesses testify or observe their demeanor,\nand therefore should be slow to reverse the trial court’s decision. It is however, not lost on this court that an appeal is in a way a\nretrial. It therefore must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions. In the case of Peters vs. Sunday\nPosts Ltd [1958] E.A. 424  at page 429, the Court of Appeal rendered itself thus:\n“It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the finding, on a question of fact, of the Judge who tried the case,\nand who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. An appellate court has, indeed, jurisdiction to review the\nevidence in order to determine whether the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand. But this is a\njurisdiction which should be exercised with caution, it is not enough that the appellate court might itself have come to a\ndifferent conclusion.”\n16. Parental responsibility is defined under PART III, section 23(1) of the Children Act to mean all the duties, rights, powers,\nresponsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child. The child envisaged under the Children\nAct is any human being who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. It is noteworthy however that parental responsibility in respect\nof a child who has attained the age of majority can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to\nthe welfare of the child. The special circumstances are provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act which stipulates thus:\n“Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child’s eighteenth\nbirthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the\nwelfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made:\nProvided that the order may be applied for after the child’s eighteenth birthday.”\n17. Section 91(b)  of the Children Act further provides for exceptional circumstances when a person who is not a child can apply to\nthe court for a maintenance order. The section states thus:\n“Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the\nmaintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the\nmaintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a “maintenance order,” as the court may see fit;\nProvided that-\n(a)…\n(b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance\norder to be made in his favor in the following circumstances-\n(i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or\n(ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/6\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\n(iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person’s\neighteenth birthday; or\n(iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order.”\n18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the\nfact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently\npursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs.\n130,000/= per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children’s education is attributable to the fact that he has been\npresent in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education.\n19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until\nafter she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children’s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th\nFebruary, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld]\nInstitute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent’s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now\nstates is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education.\n20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at\n[Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course\nduration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016/2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th\nMay, 2017 the 2016/2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled\nfor the program.  There is also no copy of the Respondent’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her\nqualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education.\n21. The Appellant’s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of\ninstituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the\nRespondent’s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought\nmeant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education.\n22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where\nthere has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the\nRespondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend\nfor herself and cater for her further education.\n23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the\nAppellant’s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the\nRespondent’s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state “ it\nis common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an\nalternative source of income which he did not disclose. ” Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September,\n2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was\nhowever no evidence of the Appellant’s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income.\n24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than\nchildren born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also\nstruggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to\nextend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent’s diploma course.\n25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination\nhowever is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders\nthat were granted in the lower court.\n26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental\nresponsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/6\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\nEducation, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education.\n27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18)\nyears, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to\ncompel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental\nresponsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See – Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie\nWaiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ).\n28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary\nschool education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the\nAppellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the\nAppellant has never contributed towards the Respondent’s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or\nomissions.\n29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant’s doing to be out of the Respondent’s life. In her\nexamination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had\ncompleted her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross-\nexamination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to\nstate:\n“He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for\nmy father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I\ndidn’t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. ”\n30. From the Respondent’s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years\npost-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the\ntime of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school\neducation. It therefore appears that the Respondent’s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by\nthe Respondent’s interaction with the Appellant’s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross-\nexamination told the trial court “… My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook…I want the Defendant to pay Kshs.\n132,000/- per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000/- per year. The Defendant’s children are in public universities. ”\n31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to\n[Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part\nof the Respondent’s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows:\n“My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don’t talk about\nfees with my step sister.\nCourt: Is your admission to M still available\"\nPlaintiff: No. I wouldn’t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July.\nCourt: If you go back will they take you\"\nPlaintiff: Yes it was a diploma.\nCourt: What did you get in KCSE\"\nPlaintiff: A C plain. ”\n32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/6\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\nalluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her\nadmission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU.\nShe did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all\nthe Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in\nmind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees.\n33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the\nRespondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to\ncompel the Appellant to cater for.\n34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of\nmajority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent’s tertiary education. This is because he has\nalways been aware of the existence of his other children and therefore planned for their needs, unlike the Respondent herein. In any\nevent, the Respondent is an adult who can seek employment and cater for her own college fees. Further, in the instant case, the\nRespondent failed to smoothly transition into tertiary education and is not certain of where she wants to pursue her tertiary\neducation.\n35. In the end, I find that the Respondent is not deserving of the orders extending parental responsibility against the Appellant. The\nresult is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is consequently allowed.

        "cleaned_text": "CM v SWA [2019] eKLR REPUBLIC OF KENYA IN THE HIGH COURT OF KENYA AT NAIROBI CIVIL APPEAL NO. 21 OF 2018 CM APPELLANT VERSUS SWA .. RESPONDENT (Being an appeal from the judgment and decree of the Honorable Resident Magistrate H. M. Mbati (Mrs.) delivered on the 21st February, 2018 in Nairobi Children s Case No. 698 of 2017 ) JUDGMENT 1. In a judgment dated 21st February, 2018 the Children Court at Nairobi in Case No. 698 of 2017 made orders directing that the defendant pay in the first instance Kshs. 132,500 towards the school fees needs of the plaintiff and that the mother do provide for all other school related expenses because parental responsibility is shared. 2. Aggrieved by the decision, the defendant, who is the Appellant herein, approached the court by way of a memorandum of appeal dated 27th February, 2019 and filed on 20th June, 2018. The Appellant is asking the court to set aside the judgment and order of the Children s Court given on 21st February, 2018, and condemn the Respondent to pay the costs of this appeal. 3. The Appellant advanced twelve (12) grounds of appeal the gist of which is that the honorable learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by allowing the suit filed by the Respondent for extension of parental responsibility whereas: 1. The Respondent had confirmed during the hearing of the matter that the admission letter to East African Institute of Certified Studies, Nairobi produced as an exhibit in the case had lapsed and her place in the said college was no longer available. 2. The Respondent had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability as expected in civil proceedings as she failed to produce her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) to confirm that parental responsibility could be extended beyond eighteen (18) years by virtue of her qualification for admission to an institution of higher learning. 3. It was evident from the Appellant s net salary as exhibited in his pay slip that he could not afford to pay Kshs. 132,500 towards the Respondent s college fees. Further that no evidence was presented to support the holding that even though the Appellant was straining financially, he had other alternative sources of income to support the Respondent s school needs. 4. The Respondent had failed to demonstrate the special circumstances envisaged under section 28(1) of the Children Act with regard to the welfare of the child to warrant an order for extension of parental responsibility. Instead, the learned magistrate misconstrued the law and held that regardless of the circumstances, once paternity is proved, extension of parental responsibility would be a matter of natural course. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 5. The Respondent has been out of school for four (4) years and is engaged in personal income generating undertakings, modeling and marketing, which she admitted to during her evidence in court. 6. The Respondent s mother had elected to disown the Appellant as admitted by the Respondent in her evidence and the Appellant therefore organized his life and financial needs as circumstances would dictate, including acquisition of loans. That there is therefore nothing sinister about the said loans because it is the Respondent who elected to sit on her rights. 4. The appeal came up for directions on 24th January, 2019 where upon application by counsel for the Respondent the court directed that the appeal be disposed of by way of written submissions. The matter had initially been referred to mediation but the parties failed to reach a settlement as indicated in the Mediator s Report dated 6th November, 2018. 5. Learned Counsel Mr. Sumba filed written submissions dated 4th February, 2019 on behalf of the Appellant in which he reiterated the grounds of the appeal and asked the court to allow the appeal in the terms prayed. Counsel urged that extension of parental responsibility cannot be conferred to the Respondent without proof that she qualified to join an institution of higher learning. Further that the Appellant s resources are not sufficient to cater for his five (5) children and still pay for the Respondent s college fees. 6. Mr. Sumba asserted that the Respondent s application in the Children s Court was premised on section 28(1) of the Children Act which required that the Respondent demonstrate exceptional circumstances for parental responsibility to be extended but this was not discharged. Counsel stated that the Respondent failed to exhibit a certificate for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate that she qualified to join college. Further that she had been out of school for a period of four (4) years and was in gainful employment. That in any event, the copy of the letter of admission had already lapsed even at the time the court held that fees be paid. 7. In opposition, learned counsel Mr. Seth Ojienda filed written submissions dated 25th March, 2019 on behalf of the Respondent in which he submitted that it is in the best interest of the of the Respondent that the court sustain the lower court judgment and decree. 8. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that the Respondent approached the Children s Court seeking extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant since she had secured admission to pursue a diploma in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies but could not raise the fees of Kshs. 132,500 . This prompted her to file the application since the Appellant, her biological father, had the means to pay for her tertiary education. 9. Mr. Ojienda submitted that parental responsibility is automatic and self-activating on parents upon the birth of a child and fathers cannot have the discretion of either rejecting or accepting that responsibility. That the fact that the Appellant failed to participate in the general upbringing of the Respondent does not absolve him from exercising parental responsibility over her. 10. Counsel asserted that section 28 of the Children Act provides that parental responsibility in respect of a child beyond the age of eighteen years can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That section 91 of the Children Act further provides for circumstances under which a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. 11. Mr. Ojienda submitted that the Children Act defines education to mean the giving of intellectual, moral, spiritual instruction or other training to a child. Counsel asserted that basic education is more than just learning how to read, write and calculate. It encompasses the broadest possible sense of learning at any stage of life and it is not confined to childhood and formative years. Counsel stated that the court has power to extend the right to education to a child of over eighteen (18) years if the court is satisfied upon application or on its own motion that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That in the instant case, the special circumstance was that the Respondent required the Applicant to pay for her college fees. 12. Counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of the Kenyan education system where a child starts school at the age of 6 years and remains reliant upon their parents for school fees, university or college fees beyond the age of eighteen (18) years. That it is the Respondent s desperation to pursue higher education that made her file the suit before the lower court. 13. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that even though the Respondent is a child born out of wedlock, Article 53 of the Constitution http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR and the Children Act provide for the principles of equality and non-discrimination of legimate and illegitimate children. Counsel asserted that the Appellant has children from his current marriage for whom he is able and willing to provide for including payment of school fees for higher education. 14. Mr. Ojienda noted that the Appellant has a daughter one MDA who is pursuing an undergraduate program in Education (Arts) at [Particulars withheld] University for whom he pays a total of one hundred and twenty six thousand shillings (Kshs. 126,000 ) per academic year. That the Respondent s reluctance to cater for the Respondent s school fees to pursue a diploma in journalism therefore amounts to discrimination. Counsel urged that the Appellant being able to afford school fees for his children within the marriage set up is compelled by law to provide for the Respondent albeit born out of wedlock. 15. The court has considered the grounds of appeal, the various authorities referred to by both counsels on record and their rival arguments to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. This court is alive to the fact that it did not hear the witnesses testify or observe their demeanor, and therefore should be slow to reverse the trial court s decision. It is however, not lost on this court that an appeal is in a way a retrial. It therefore must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions. In the case of Peters vs. Sunday Posts Ltd [1958] E.A. 424 at page 429, the Court of Appeal rendered itself thus: It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the finding, on a question of fact, of the Judge who tried the case, and who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. An appellate court has, indeed, jurisdiction to review the evidence in order to determine whether the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand. But this is a jurisdiction which should be exercised with caution, it is not enough that the appellate court might itself have come to a different conclusion. 16. Parental responsibility is defined under PART III, section 23(1) of the Children Act to mean all the duties, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child. The child envisaged under the Children Act is any human being who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. It is noteworthy however that parental responsibility in respect of a child who has attained the age of majority can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances are provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act which stipulates thus: Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child s eighteenth birthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made: Provided that the order may be applied for after the child s eighteenth birthday. 17. Section 91(b) of the Children Act further provides for exceptional circumstances when a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. The section states thus: Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the maintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a maintenance order, as the court may see fit; Provided that- (a) (b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance order to be made in his favor in the following circumstances- (i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR (iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order. 18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the fact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs. 130,000 per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children s education is attributable to the fact that he has been present in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education. 19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until after she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th February, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now states is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education. 20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course duration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016 2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th May, 2017 the 2016 2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled for the program. There is also no copy of the Respondent s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her qualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education. 21. The Appellant s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of instituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the Respondent s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought meant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education. 22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where there has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the Respondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend for herself and cater for her further education. 23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the Appellant s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the Respondent s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state it is common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an alternative source of income which he did not disclose. Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September, 2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was however no evidence of the Appellant s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income. 24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than children born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also struggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to extend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent s diploma course. 25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination however is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders that were granted in the lower court. 26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR Education, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education. 27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18) years, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to compel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental responsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie Waiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ). 28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary school education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the Appellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the Appellant has never contributed towards the Respondent s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or omissions. 29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant s doing to be out of the Respondent s life. In her examination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had completed her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross- examination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to state: He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for my father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I didn t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. 30. From the Respondent s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years post-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the time of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school education. It therefore appears that the Respondent s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by the Respondent s interaction with the Appellant s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross- examination told the trial court My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook I want the Defendant to pay Kshs. 132,000 - per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000 - per year. The Defendant s children are in public universities. 31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part of the Respondent s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows: My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don t talk about fees with my step sister. Court: Is your admission to M still available\" Plaintiff: No. I wouldn t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July. Court: If you go back will they take you\" Plaintiff: Yes it was a diploma. Court: What did you get in KCSE\" Plaintiff: A C plain. 32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR alluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her admission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU. She did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all the Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in mind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees. 33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the Respondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to compel the Appellant to cater for. 34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of majority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent s tertiary education. This is because he has always been aware of the existence of his other children and therefore planned for their needs, unlike the Respondent herein. In any event, the Respondent is an adult who can seek employment and cater for her own college fees. Further, in the instant case, the Respondent failed to smoothly transition into tertiary education and is not certain of where she wants to pursue her tertiary education. 35. In the end, I find that the Respondent is not deserving of the orders extending parental responsibility against the Appellant. The result is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is consequently allowed. The judgment and order of the Children Court at Nairobi made on 21st February, 2018 is hereby set aside forthwith. Based on the nature of this appeal, each party shall bear their own costs. It is so ordered. SIGNED DATED AND DELIVERED IN OPEN COURT THIS 7TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2019. . L. A. ACHODE HIGH COURT JUDGE In the presence of ..Advocate for the Appellant.

The section states thus: Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the maintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a maintenance order, as the court may see fit; Provided that- (a) (b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance order to be made in his favor in the following circumstances- (i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR (iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order. 18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the fact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs. 130,000 per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children s education is attributable to the fact that he has been present in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education. 19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until after she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th February, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now states is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education. 20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course duration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016 2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th May, 2017 the 2016 2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled for the program. There is also no copy of the Respondent s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her qualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education. 21. The Appellant s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of instituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the Respondent s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought meant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education. 22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where there has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the Respondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend for herself and cater for her further education. 23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the Appellant s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the Respondent s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state it is common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an alternative source of income which he did not disclose. Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September, 2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was however no evidence of the Appellant s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income. 24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than children born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also struggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to extend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent s diploma course. 25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination however is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders that were granted in the lower court. 26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR Education, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education. 27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18) years, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to compel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental responsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie Waiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ). 28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary school education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the Appellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the Appellant has never contributed towards the Respondent s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or omissions. 29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant s doing to be out of the Respondent s life. In her examination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had completed her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross- examination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to state: He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for my father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I didn t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. 30. From the Respondent s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years post-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the time of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school education. It therefore appears that the Respondent s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by the Respondent s interaction with the Appellant s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross- examination told the trial court My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook I want the Defendant to pay Kshs. 132,000 - per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000 - per year. The Defendant s children are in public universities. 31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part of the Respondent s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows: My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don t talk about fees with my step sister. Court: Is your admission to M still available\" Plaintiff: No. I wouldn t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July. Court: If you go back will they take you\" Plaintiff: Yes it was a diploma. Court: What did you get in KCSE\" Plaintiff: A C plain. 32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 6 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR alluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her admission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU. She did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all the Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in mind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees. 33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the Respondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to compel the Appellant to cater for. 34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of majority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent s tertiary education. This is because he has always been aware of the existence of his other children and therefore planned for their needs, unlike the Respondent herein. In any event, the Respondent is an adult who can seek employment and cater for her own college fees. Further, in the instant case, the Respondent failed to smoothly transition into tertiary education and is not certain of where she wants to pursue her tertiary education. 35. In the end, I find that the Respondent is not deserving of the orders extending parental responsibility against the Appellant. The result is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is consequently allowed. The judgment and order of the Children Court at Nairobi made on 21st February, 2018 is hereby set aside forthwith. Based on the nature of this appeal, each party shall bear their own costs. It is so ordered. SIGNED DATED AND DELIVERED IN OPEN COURT THIS 7TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2019. . L. A. ACHODE HIGH COURT JUDGE In the presence of ..Advocate for the Appellant.

Subsequently, the respondent\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/24\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nfailed to effect special clearance of the cheque out\nof which, to the knowledge of the respondent,\nfunds were to be made available to the same\nArthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a\nbusiness trip to Southern Africa and who had to\nleave without the money. By reason of matters\ncomplained of, the appellant suffered loss of a\ncustomer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of\nbusiness. In consequence thereof, the appellant\nclaimed from the respondent General damages for\nbreach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel\nand for negligence, costs and interests on the\nabove.\n The respondent filed a statement of defence\nbasically denying the entire claim. Thereafter,\nliability as against the respondent was settled by\nconsent of the parties, vide which the respondent\nadmitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of\ncheque. There followed a formal proof in which\nNyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William\nOgwayo were the only witnesses. Subsequently,\nthe trial court held as follows; (hence the appeal)\n“As I have already said substantive damages can\nonly be awarded under one head of damages; in\nthis case for injurious falsehood. The damages for\nbreach of contract I worked out now in all at\nKshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false\nhood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is\nevidence that the cheque was eventually paid to\nMr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the\nsuit and interests on the damages awarded from\nthe date of this judgment.”\n \nIssues:\ni.Whether the amount of damages for\nbreach of contract under section 57 of the\nBills of Exchange Act, Cap 27, Laws of\nKenya; is the equivalent of the amount\nforming the dishonoured bill.\nii.Whether nominal damages as opposed to\nsubstantial damages can be awarded for\nbreach of contract\nCommercial Law  – negotiable  Instruments -\npromissory notes - bills of exchange - cheques –\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/24\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\ndishonoured cheques - rights of the holders to\ndishonoured cheques - liabilities of person issuing\ndishonoured cheques – measure of damages to\nparties to dishonoured cheques - Whether the\namount of damages for breach of contract under\nsection 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act, Cap 27,\nLaws of Kenya; is the equivalent of the amount\nforming the dishonoured bill – Bills of Exchange\nAct section 57\nDamages -  assessment of damages – nominal\ndamages – assessment of damages to parties to\ndishonoured cheques - principles the Court of\nAppeal will apply in considering whether to\ninterfere with an award of damages by the High\nCourt on a claim for breach of contract – whether\nnominal damages as opposed to substantial\ndamages can be awarded for breach of contract\n- Bills of Exchange Act section 57\n \nSection 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act provided\nthat;\n“Where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of\ndamages, which shall be deemed to be liquidated\ndamages, shall be as follows—\na.the holder may recover from any party\nliable on the bill, and the drawer who has\nbeen compelled to pay the bill may recover\nfrom the acceptor, and an endorser who\nhas been compelled to pay the bill may\nrecover from the acceptor or from the\ndrawer or from a prior endorser—\ni.the amount of the bill;\nii.interest thereon from the time of\npresentment for payment if the bill is\npayable on demand, and from the maturity\nof the bill in any other case;\niii.the expenses of noting, or when protest is\nnecessary, and the protest has been\nextended, the expenses of protest;\nb.in the case of a bill which has been\ndishonoured abroad, in lieu of the above\ndamages, the holder may recover from the\ndrawer or an endorser, and the drawer or\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/24\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nan endorser who has been compelled to\npay the bill may recover from any party\nliable to him, the amount of the re-\nexchange with interest thereon until the\ntime of payment; where by this Act interest\nmay be recovered as damages, the\ninterest may, if justice require it, be\nwithheld wholly or in part, and where a bill\nis expressed to be payable with interest at\na given rate, interest as damages may or\nmay not be given at the same rate as\ninterest proper.”\nHeld:\n1.There was no need for the trial court to\nspecifically mention the respondent’s\nfailure to so accord the said cheque\nspecial clearance as the respondent’s\nfailure to do so was part of the wrong doing\nfor which the respondent admitted liability.\nIt was in order for the trial court just to note\nthat liability had been admitted. There was\ntherefore no obligation on the trial court to\ninterrogate again in their judgment the\nfactual base forming the admission of\nliability. Therefore, there was no merit in\nthat complaint and it was accordingly\ndismissed.\n2.From the testimony of PW1 he was not\nsure whether the cheque had been\nrepresented or not. On the representations\nbefore court, there was nothing before the\ntrial court for him to rule out the possibility\nof the cheque having been represented\nand paid. Second, PW1 admitted they paid\ntheir client. There was however no mention\nthat they eventually paid their client from\nother sources. In the premises, the trial\ncourt was therefore entitled on the facts\nbefore it to assume that payment to the\nappellant’s client was made from the\nvalue of the same cheque that had\npreviously been dishonoured. Therefore,\nthere was no merit in that complaint and it\nwas accordingly dismissed.\n3.There was no specific pleading for the\napplication of the provisions of section 57\nof the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27Laws of\nKenya in the appellant’s plaint. By reason\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/24\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nof the words “ shall be deemed to be\nliquidated”  in section 57 of the Bill of\nExchange Act, denoted that any party\nwishing to avail itself of that provision had\nto lay its claim in the manner liquidated\nclaim was laid, that is by being specifically\npleading it with particulars, and then\nspecifically proving it.\n4.There was no specific prayer by the\nappellant that the quantum of damages\npayable to them on account of the\ndishonoured cheque should be based on\nits value as stipulated by section 57 of the\nBill of Exchange Act.\n5.The framing of the prayers in the plaint by\nthe appellant left room for the trial court to\nexercise its discretion in determining the\nmeasure of damages payable. Paragraph\n5 of the plaint simply indicated that as the\namount forming the dishonoured cheque.\nParagraph 10 gave particulars of the loss\nwith no particularization, whereas the\nreliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in\ngeneral terms. In the result, nothing was\nwrong in the mode of approach adopted by\nthe trial court when assessing damages\npayable in the instant matter.\n6.The appellant did not plead any specific\nmeasure of interest that he intended\napplied to any resulting figure that may be\nadjudged in their favour. The position in\nlaw on unpleaded issues was settled in\nthat the object of pleadings is of course to\nensure that both parties shall know what\nare the points in issue between them, so\nthat each may have full information of the\ncase he has to meet and prepare his\nevidence to support his own case or to\nmeet that of his opponent. As a rule relief\nnot founded on the pleadings will not be\ngiven.\n7.PW1 in his testimony to court asked for\ninterest at commercial rates. Even if the\ninstant Court were to take it that that\nrequest removed the appellant’s claim\nfrom the rule on strict compliance with\nones pleadings and then placed it into the\ncategory of matters falling for the court’s\nadjudication by virtue of those having been\nraised in the course of the trial, testified\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/24\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nupon and submission made thereof, the\nquestion was whether the trial court was\nbound by PW1’s request for interest at\ncommercial rate. It was not.\n8.Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act\nprovided that interest on damages\nassessed at large started running from the\ndate of assessment as the date when\nliability arose. Therefore, there was no\nreason as to why the trial court should\nhave departed from a path well beaten as\nregards awarding of interest on damages\nat large. The judge was right and that\nstand was affirmed.\n9.A person who is not a trader is not entitled\nto recover substantial damages for the\nwrongful dishonour of his cheque unless\nthe damage which he has suffered is\nalleged and proved as special damages.\nThe trial court drew out general principles\nof law as applying to the matter before it,\nnamely damages for breach of contract\narising from claims based on a\ndishonoured cheques under that head\nwhere the claimant was not a trader, he\nwas only entitled to nominal damages,\nwhere some loss had been occasioned to\nthe claimant beyond nominal damages\nsubstantial damages had to be claimed as\na special damage. The trial court also took\ninto consideration the fact that the cheque\nwas eventually paid to the client ( Mr.\nOgwayo.)\n10.The funds forming the dishonoured cheque\nwere never meant for the benefit of the\nappellant. The client (Mr. Ogwayo) himself\nin his testimony said he had wanted to\nsever completely the client advocate\nrelationship with the appellant but his wife,\nintervened and in fact he thereafter gave\nsome business to the appellant after the\nincident subject to his appeal. The fact of\ntotal loss of client was therefore ruled out.\nOn the basis of the above, the trial court\nopined that in the circumstances of the\nfacts before it, the appellant could only\nrecover under injurious falsehood.\nDamages for libel and negligence were\ndiscounted. None of the case law\nassessed above was shown to have\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/24\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nfactored in damages for negligence. In the\nresult, there was no fault in the trial court’s\ndiscounting of the negligence as the court\nwas within the principles of case law\nassessed and applied by him.\n11.Special damages had to not only be\nspecifically claimed but also strictly proved.\nThe appellant failed to do so.\n12.The appellant’s claim was laid at large.\nAny claim beyond the injury to reputation\nhad to be pleaded as a special damage.\nBy this was meant that the actual loss had\nto be calculated and claimed. The fact that\nthe customer ( Ogwayo) gave away to other\nadvocates some of the briefs which should\nhave been monopolized by the appellant\nthough admitted in the oral testimony of\nPW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify\nand prove the actual loss. That should\nhave been tabulated and claimed as such.\nTherefore, there was no merit in the\nappellant’s complaint that an award for\nsubstantial damages should have been\nmade in his favour.\n13.Nominal damage is a technical phrase\nwhich means that you have negated\nanything like real damage, but that you are\naffirming by your nominal damages that\nthere is an infraction of a legal right which,\nthough it gives you no right to any real\ndamages at all, yet gives you a right to the\nverdict or judgment because your legal\nright has been infringed. But the term\nnominal damage does not mean small\ndamages. The extent to which a person\nhas a right to recover what is called by the\ncompendious phrase damages but may\nalso be represented as compensation for\nthe use of something that belongs to him,\ndepends upon a variety of circumstances\nand it certainly does not in the smallest\ndegree suggest that because they are\nsmall, they are necessarily nominal\ndamages.\n14.Nominal damages can also be spoken of\nas a sum that may be spoken of but that\nhas not existence in point of quantity” and\nas a “mere peg on which to hang costs.”\nWhere damages are at large and cannot\nbe quantified, the court may have to\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7/24\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nassess damages upon some conventional\nyardstick. But if a specific loss is to be\ncompensated and the party was given a\nchance to prove the loss and he did not he\ncannot have more than nominal damages.\n15.Applying the foregoing on normal\ndamages; therefore, the appellant’s claim\ndid not fall into the category of claims that\nqualified for nominal damages only\nbecause the appellant was not merely\nseeking to negative a right but was saying\nthat by the reason of his professional\nstanding as a firm of advocates\ndishonouring a cheque payable on its\nbehalf had repercussion on their\nprofessional standing.\n16.A person who was not a trader could\nrecover substantial rather than\nnominaldamages in contract for loss of\ncredit or business reputation resulting from\na cheque being wrongly dishonoured by\nhis bank. The appellant was trading as a\nfirm of advocates. They were therefore in\nbusiness. Their claim fell outside the\nnominal damages bracket but with a\ncaveat that any intended award of\ndamages could not be so high because if\nalleged heavy losses were involved then\nthose should have been quantified and\nclaimed as special damages. The court\nhad no quarrel with the appellant’s\nassertion that the reputation of the\nappellant as a professional firm of\nadvocates meant everything. But as\nobserved elsewhere damage to the\nreputation of this firm was minimized by\nmatters in controversy being confined to\nthe appellant, the respondent and the\nappellant’s then affected client.\n17.The award to that firm of advocates with\ncapacity to handle briefs worth millions\nshould have been something beyond\nnominal damage, but not so high\nconsidering the other head of damages\nwas also related to this head.\nAppeal partially allowed. The award of 1 million\n(Kshs. 1,000,000.00)for injurious falsehood was\naffirmed but the award ofKshs.10, 000.00nominal\ndamage was set aside and substituted it with an\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8/24\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\naward of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach\nof contract.

No. 2410 of 1999)\n****************\nJUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nIntroduction.\nThe appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates  filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410 of\n1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited.  The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day of\nDecember, 1999. The appellant’s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant\ndrew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur William\nOgwayo. On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on or about\nthe 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the\nknowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William\nOgwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money.\nBy reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and\nreputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent\nGeneral damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and\ninterests on the above.\nThe respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying the\nentire claim.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12/24\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of\nMay, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There\nfollowed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng  Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the\nonly witnesses.\nJudgment of the High Court.\nParties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J  in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February, 2004\ndelivered himself inter alia thus:-\n“As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages;\nin this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at\nKshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is\nevidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of\nthe suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment.”\nGrounds of appeal\nThe appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal.\nThese are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:-\n(1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special\nclearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. \n(2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff’s\ncheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a\ncheque. \n(3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence that\nthe dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. \n(4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. \n(5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not date\nof judgment. \n(6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant’s Advocates. \n(7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely\ninjuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. \n(8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence\nbefore him. \n(9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the\nfacts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff.” \nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13/24\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n(10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting order\nof that judgment. \nThe appellant’s submissions\nThe appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge’s findings on the grounds that the learned trial Judge\nfell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57  of the Bills of\nExchange Act Cap 27  Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for breach of\ncontract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii) when he\nerroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of substantial\ndamages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters that the\ncheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages which had\nbeen pleaded and proved.\nRespondent’s submissions.\nIn response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge’s decision and dismiss the\nappellant’s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors\nfavouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and\nalso overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in\nunequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the\nlibel reached only one person, the appellant’s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect\nthe integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case.\nTurning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent’s arguments that these fell within\nthe threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the guiding\nprinciple that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court’s discretion.\nThe respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the award\nof damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured cheque of\nKshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the country with\nthe said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of the said\ncheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the dishonoured\ncheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section 57 of the Bills\nof Exchange Act Cap 27  laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages; that the appellant\nwas not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither pleaded nor specifically\nproved these.\nAs for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the appellant’s\noral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30% because it was also not pleaded\nin the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have been\nmanifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on\ndamages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 14/24\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to\nhim as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to\nhis reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they\nwere indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge.\nThe Appellant’s Authorities.\nThe appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich  Building Society [1964]\n4 ALLER 119  for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather\nthan nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque being\nwrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1 ALL\nER 316 for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where there\nwas no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in\ninstances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to\nmeet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and  another versus Barclays Bank limited\n[1936] 1 ALL ER 653  for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a\ndebt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the\ndefendant’s hands.\nRespondent’s Authorities.\nThe respondent on the other hand   relied on the legal text of Ellinger’s Modern Banking Law Fourth\nEdition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page 461 for\nthe proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the bank’s part\nand in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any carelessly\ncomposed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as defamation\nprovided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of  Banking\nTwelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit of a\ncustomer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a customer\nwill be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to his\nreputation.\nTurning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus  West Minister\nBank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577  for the proposition that:\n“A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful\ndishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as\nspecial damages”; the decision in the case of  Mbogo and another versus  Shah [1968] EA 93  for the\nproposition that “ a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a\njudge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a\nwrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly\nwrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice.”\nThe decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67.  At page 75 this\nCourt made observation thus:-\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 15/24\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\n“To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not\nnecessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite\nmodest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive.\n.......\nIt is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made, but\nagain they must not be excessive....”\nOn the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:-\n“A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial  damages for the wrongful\ndishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a\nspecial damage.......”\nLastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim & another versus Kikaua [1988]  KLR 534. In this\ncase, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of  Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu\n[1965] EA 592  and went on to hold inter alia that:-\n“According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of\nassessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant’s liability\nto pay does arise.”\nThe Mandate of the Court.\nThis is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the\nrecord before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the\ncase of Sumaria & Another versus Allied Industries Limited  [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being\nthat in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a\nfinding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of\nthe evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching\nthe finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi & another [2007] 2KLR 159  .\nWe have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re-evaluated\nand re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following\ndetermination in the appellant’s complaints;\nDetermination of issue No.1\nOn the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to\nspecifically mention the respondent’s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the\nrespondent’s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It\nwas in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no\nobligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the\nadmission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 16/24\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nDetermination of issue No.2\nThe scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi\nOchieng Nyamogo  on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:-\n“As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to pay\nthe money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland.\n....\nReceived two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized eventually\nwe paid our client....”\nWhen cross examined by Mr. Majanja,  PW1 had this response to make:-\n“The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We\npaid Mr. Ogwayo the money.”\nMr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had\nthis to say:-\n“I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward\ntransmission to me......\nFrom the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the\nabove representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the\ncheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was\nhowever no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the\nlearned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the\nappellant’s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured.\nWe find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed.\nDetermination of issue No.3\nThere was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57  of the Bills of\nExchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant’s plaint.\nThe relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;-\n“57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated\ndamages shall be as follows......\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 17/24\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nBy reason of the words “ shall be deemed to be liquidated”  denotes that any party wishing to avail itself\nof that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically\npleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it.\nThere was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account\nof the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57  of the Bill of\nExchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1’s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose from\nthe conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of\n30/3/1999, that  Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan & Stratton had written to PW1.\nThe content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant’s testimony in court when\nhe made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant should be\nbased on the value of the dishonoured cheque.\nThe framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his\ndiscretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated\nthis as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no\nparticularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms.\nIn the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when\nassessing damages payable herein.\nDetermination of issue No.4\nWith regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant’s prayer was for.\n“(e) Costs and interest on the above.”\n“And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment”\nSection 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides:\n26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree\norder interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum\nadjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged\non such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such\nrate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the\ndecree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit.\n2 ..........”\nIt was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of\ninterest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position\nin law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 18/24\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\npredecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited\n[1956] Volume XXII  EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president  inter alia had this to observe at page 140\nparagraph 3:-\n“The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points\nin issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and\nprepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not\nfounded on the pleadings will not be given....”\nAfter citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris  [1930] 1.K.B. 682-  he\nadded the following:-\n“Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues they\nmust be placed on the record by amendment....”\nThis position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the\ncase of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476.  Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph\n9-11 had this to say:-\n“On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been pleaded,\nthe attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in India. In East\nAfrica the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its decision on\nan unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the unpleaded issue has\nin fact been left to the court for decision....”\nPW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it\nthat this request removed the appellant’s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings\nand then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court’s adjudication by virtue of these\nhaving been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is\nwhether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1’s request for interest at commercial rate. He was\nnot.\nIn the case of Salim & another versus Kikava (supra)  this Court revisited and confirmed the provisions\nof section 26  of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large starts\nrunning from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why the\nlearned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on\ndamages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand.\nDetermination of issue number 5.\nThe learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the authorities\ncites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus  Bank of Baroda (supra)  and the\ndecision in  Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building  Society (supra).\nThe decision in Kpohror (supra)  which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on\nenunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that “a person who is not a trader is not entitled to\nrecover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 19/24\n\n--- PAGE 20 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nsuffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed\nthe defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a\nmatter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett & another case  (supra) it simply stated\ninter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient\nfunds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the\ndrawer; the words “ refer to drawer ” in the circumstances were held not to be “ a libel.”\nThe learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely\ndamages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head\nwhere the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been\noccasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a\nspecial damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case  (supra) was distinguished by the learned\nJudge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00  had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial\nJudge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo.\nThe funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr.\nOgwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship\nwith the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant\nafter the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis\nof the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant\ncould only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None\nof the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the\nappellant’s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra),  the holding is inter alia that “ word refer to\ndrawer”, does not amount to libel”. In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge’s discounting\nof the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him.\nDetermination of issue No.6\nThe complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award of\nnominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together.\nDetermination of issue No.7\nThis relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge’s failure to make provision for an award of special\ndamages. Shiraku case (supra)  is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as a\nspecial damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716  for the proposition that\nspecial damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do\nso.\nDetermination of issue number 8.\nThe head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of\ncontract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 20/24\n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nThe principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the superior\ncourt’s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden path. Sir\nCharles New Bold  P. in the case of  Mbogo & another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96\nparagraph G-H had this to say:-\n“For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the\nexercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his\ndiscretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or\nunless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the\nexercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice”\nSee also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of  Butler versus Butler\n[1984] KLR 225  wherein it was held inter alia that:-\n“The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an\nappellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong\nprinciples or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he\nhas taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at\na wrong decision.”\nIn addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court’s attention to the\nprovisions of section 16A (1)  of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:-\n“In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount as\nit may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death,\nthe amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect\nof an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount\nassessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings”\nThe appellant’s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters averred\nto therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of business.\nIn paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:-\n“11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant’s actions were\ncalculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade.\n12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered\ngeneral loss on their said business. \n13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious\npublication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in\nits credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt” \nAll the above averments indicate that the appellant’s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed\nabove indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 21/24\n\n--- PAGE 22 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\nBy this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer\nOgwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the\nappellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove\nthe actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the\nappellant’s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour.\nAs for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank  Limited\n[1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that\n“The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal  damages in respect of the wrongful\ndishonor of a cheque by her bank.”\nGrabbe JA.    in the case of  Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484  at page\n487 paragraph G-I had this to say:-\n“Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real\ndamage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal\nright which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the\nverdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage\ndoes not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called\nby the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use\nof something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does\nnot in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal\ndamages.\nIn the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B.  494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at\nP.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in\npoint of quantity” and as a “mere peg on which to hang costs.”\nIn Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242,  this Court held inter alia that\nwhere damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon\nsome conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a\nchance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages.\nApplying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the\nappellant’s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because\nthe appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his\nprofessional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion\non their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich\nBuilding Society (supra)  wherein it was held inter alia that:\n“A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal  damages in\ncontract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly\ndishonoured by his bank”; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages\nwere awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates.\nThey were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 22/24\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\nNyamogo & Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR\ncaveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were\ninvolved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no\nquarrel with the appellant’s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of\nadvocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the\nreputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the\nrespondent and the appellant’s then affected client.\nThe award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been\nsomething beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also\nrelated to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 .\nIn the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for\ninjurious falsehood but set aside the award of  Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an\naward of Kshs.500, 000.00  as damages for breach of contract. The appellant will have half the costs of\nthis appeal.\nDated and Delivered at Nairobi this 8th day of May, 2015.\n \nR.N.

Their complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4, 376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo on order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo. Subsequently, the respondent http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. The respondent filed a statement of defence basically denying the entire claim. Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Subsequently, the trial court held as follows; (hence the appeal) As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Issues: i.Whether the amount of damages for breach of contract under section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act, Cap 27, Laws of Kenya; is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill. ii.Whether nominal damages as opposed to substantial damages can be awarded for breach of contract Commercial Law negotiable Instruments - promissory notes - bills of exchange - cheques http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR dishonoured cheques - rights of the holders to dishonoured cheques - liabilities of person issuing dishonoured cheques measure of damages to parties to dishonoured cheques - Whether the amount of damages for breach of contract under section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act, Cap 27, Laws of Kenya; is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill Bills of Exchange Act section 57 Damages - assessment of damages nominal damages assessment of damages to parties to dishonoured cheques - principles the Court of Appeal will apply in considering whether to interfere with an award of damages by the High Court on a claim for breach of contract whether nominal damages as opposed to substantial damages can be awarded for breach of contract - Bills of Exchange Act section 57 Section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act provided that; Where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages, which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, shall be as follows a.the holder may recover from any party liable on the bill, and the drawer who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from the acceptor, and an endorser who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from the acceptor or from the drawer or from a prior endorser i.the amount of the bill; ii.interest thereon from the time of presentment for payment if the bill is payable on demand, and from the maturity of the bill in any other case; iii.the expenses of noting, or when protest is necessary, and the protest has been extended, the expenses of protest; b.in the case of a bill which has been dishonoured abroad, in lieu of the above damages, the holder may recover from the drawer or an endorser, and the drawer or http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR an endorser who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from any party liable to him, the amount of the re- exchange with interest thereon until the time of payment; where by this Act interest may be recovered as damages, the interest may, if justice require it, be withheld wholly or in part, and where a bill is expressed to be payable with interest at a given rate, interest as damages may or may not be given at the same rate as interest proper. Held: 1.There was no need for the trial court to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the trial court just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the trial court to interrogate again in their judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. Therefore, there was no merit in that complaint and it was accordingly dismissed. 2.From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the representations before court, there was nothing before the trial court for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admitted they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the trial court was therefore entitled on the facts before it to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. Therefore, there was no merit in that complaint and it was accordingly dismissed. 3.There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. By reason http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated in section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act, denoted that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision had to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim was laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. 4.There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act. 5.The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the trial court to exercise its discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated that as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, nothing was wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the trial court when assessing damages payable in the instant matter. 6.The appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues was settled in that the object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given. 7.PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if the instant Court were to take it that that request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of those having been raised in the course of the trial, testified http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR upon and submission made thereof, the question was whether the trial court was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. It was not. 8.Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act provided that interest on damages assessed at large started running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arose. Therefore, there was no reason as to why the trial court should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and that stand was affirmed. 9.A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages. The trial court drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before it, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under that head where the claimant was not a trader, he was only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss had been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages had to be claimed as a special damage. The trial court also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to the client ( Mr. Ogwayo.) 10.The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. The client (Mr. Ogwayo) himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client was therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the trial court opined that in the circumstances of the facts before it, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR factored in damages for negligence. In the result, there was no fault in the trial court s discounting of the negligence as the court was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. 11.Special damages had to not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. 12.The appellant s claim was laid at large. Any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. By this was meant that the actual loss had to be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer ( Ogwayo) gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. That should have been tabulated and claimed as such. Therefore, there was no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. 13.Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negated anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. 14.Nominal damages can also be spoken of as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. Where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. 15.Applying the foregoing on normal damages; therefore, the appellant s claim did not fall into the category of claims that qualified for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonouring a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. 16.A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominaldamages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim fell outside the nominal damages bracket but with a caveat that any intended award of damages could not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then those should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court had no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. 17.The award to that firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. Appeal partially allowed. The award of 1 million (Kshs. 1,000,000.00)for injurious falsehood was affirmed but the award ofKshs.10, 000.00nominal damage was set aside and substituted it with an http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract.

No. 2410 of 1999) JUDGMENT OF THE COURT Introduction. The appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410 of 1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited. The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day of December, 1999. The appellant s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo. On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on or about the 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. The respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying the entire claim. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of May, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Judgment of the High Court. Parties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February, 2004 delivered himself inter alia thus:- As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Grounds of appeal The appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal. These are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:- (1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special clearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. (2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff s cheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a cheque. (3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence that the dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. (4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. (5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not date of judgment. (6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant s Advocates. (7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely injuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. (8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence before him. (9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR (10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting order of that judgment. The appellant s submissions The appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge s findings on the grounds that the learned trial Judge fell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for breach of contract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii) when he erroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of substantial damages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters that the cheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages which had been pleaded and proved. Respondent s submissions. In response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge s decision and dismiss the appellant s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors favouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and also overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in unequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the libel reached only one person, the appellant s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect the integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case. Turning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent s arguments that these fell within the threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the guiding principle that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court s discretion. The respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the award of damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured cheque of Kshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the country with the said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of the said cheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the dishonoured cheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages; that the appellant was not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither pleaded nor specifically proved these. As for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the appellant s oral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30 because it was also not pleaded in the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have been manifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on damages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 14 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to him as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to his reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they were indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge. The Appellant s Authorities. The appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society [1964] 4 ALLER 119 for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1 ALL ER 316 for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where there was no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in instances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to meet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and another versus Barclays Bank limited [1936] 1 ALL ER 653 for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the defendant s hands. Respondent s Authorities. The respondent on the other hand relied on the legal text of Ellinger s Modern Banking Law Fourth Edition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page 461 for the proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the bank s part and in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any carelessly composed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as defamation provided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of Banking Twelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit of a customer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a customer will be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to his reputation. Turning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577 for the proposition that: A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages ; the decision in the case of Mbogo and another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 for the proposition that a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice. The decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67. At page 75 this Court made observation thus:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 15 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not necessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite modest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive. ....... It is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made, but again they must not be excessive.... On the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:- A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a special damage....... Lastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim another versus Kikaua [1988] KLR 534. In this case, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu [1965] EA 592 and went on to hold inter alia that:- According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of assessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant s liability to pay does arise. The Mandate of the Court. This is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the record before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the case of Sumaria Another versus Allied Industries Limited [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being that in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a finding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of the evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching the finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi another [2007] 2KLR 159 . We have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re-evaluated and re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following determination in the appellant s complaints; Determination of issue No.1 On the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 16 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR Determination of issue No.2 The scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:- As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to pay the money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland. .... Received two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized eventually we paid our client.... When cross examined by Mr. Majanja, PW1 had this response to make:- The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We paid Mr. Ogwayo the money. Mr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had this to say:- I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward transmission to me...... From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the above representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the learned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. We find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed. Determination of issue No.3 There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. The relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;- 57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages shall be as follows...... http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 17 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By reason of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated denotes that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1 s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose from the conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of 30 3 1999, that Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan Stratton had written to PW1. The content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant s testimony in court when he made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant should be based on the value of the dishonoured cheque. The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated this as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when assessing damages payable herein. Determination of issue No.4 With regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant s prayer was for. (e) Costs and interest on the above. And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides: 26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree order interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such rate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit. 2 .......... It was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 18 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR predecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited [1956] Volume XXII EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president inter alia had this to observe at page 140 paragraph 3:- The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given.... After citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris [1930] 1.K.B. 682- he added the following:- Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by amendment.... This position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the case of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476. Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph 9-11 had this to say:- On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been pleaded, the attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in India. In East Africa the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its decision on an unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the unpleaded issue has in fact been left to the court for decision.... PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it that this request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of these having been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is whether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. He was not. In the case of Salim another versus Kikava (supra) this Court revisited and confirmed the provisions of section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large starts running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why the learned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand. Determination of issue number 5. The learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the authorities cites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus Bank of Baroda (supra) and the decision in Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building Society (supra). The decision in Kpohror (supra) which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on enunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that a person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 19 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR suffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed the defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a matter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett another case (supra) it simply stated inter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient funds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the drawer; the words refer to drawer in the circumstances were held not to be a libel. The learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head where the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a special damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case (supra) was distinguished by the learned Judge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00 had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial Judge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr. Ogwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the appellant s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra), the holding is inter alia that word refer to drawer , does not amount to libel . In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge s discounting of the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. Determination of issue No.6 The complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award of nominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together. Determination of issue No.7 This relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge s failure to make provision for an award of special damages. Shiraku case (supra) is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as a special damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716 for the proposition that special damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. Determination of issue number 8. The head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of contract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 20 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the superior court s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden path. Sir Charles New Bold P. in the case of Mbogo another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96 paragraph G-H had this to say:- For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice See also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of Butler versus Butler [1984] KLR 225 wherein it was held inter alia that:- The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an appellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong principles or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he has taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at a wrong decision. In addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court s attention to the provisions of section 16A (1) of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:- In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount as it may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death, the amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount assessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings The appellant s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters averred to therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:- 11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant s actions were calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade. 12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered general loss on their said business. 13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious publication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in its credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt All the above averments indicate that the appellant s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed above indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 21 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer Ogwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. As for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal damages in respect of the wrongful dishonor of a cheque by her bank. Grabbe JA. in the case of Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484 at page 487 paragraph G-I had this to say:- Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. In the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B. 494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at P.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. In Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242, this Court held inter alia that where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. Applying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the appellant s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society (supra) wherein it was held inter alia that: A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank ; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages were awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 22 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR caveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. The award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 . In the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for injurious falsehood but set aside the award of Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract. The appellant will have half the costs of this appeal. Dated and Delivered at Nairobi this 8th day of May, 2015. R.N. NAMBUYE ................................................... JUDGE OF APPEAL P.O.

Their complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4, 376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo on order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo. Subsequently, the respondent http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. The respondent filed a statement of defence basically denying the entire claim. Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Subsequently, the trial court held as follows; (hence the appeal) As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Issues: i.Whether the amount of damages for breach of contract under section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act, Cap 27, Laws of Kenya; is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill. ii.Whether nominal damages as opposed to substantial damages can be awarded for breach of contract Commercial Law negotiable Instruments - promissory notes - bills of exchange - cheques http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR dishonoured cheques - rights of the holders to dishonoured cheques - liabilities of person issuing dishonoured cheques measure of damages to parties to dishonoured cheques - Whether the amount of damages for breach of contract under section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act, Cap 27, Laws of Kenya; is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill Bills of Exchange Act section 57 Damages - assessment of damages nominal damages assessment of damages to parties to dishonoured cheques - principles the Court of Appeal will apply in considering whether to interfere with an award of damages by the High Court on a claim for breach of contract whether nominal damages as opposed to substantial damages can be awarded for breach of contract - Bills of Exchange Act section 57 Section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act provided that; Where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages, which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, shall be as follows a.the holder may recover from any party liable on the bill, and the drawer who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from the acceptor, and an endorser who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from the acceptor or from the drawer or from a prior endorser i.the amount of the bill; ii.interest thereon from the time of presentment for payment if the bill is payable on demand, and from the maturity of the bill in any other case; iii.the expenses of noting, or when protest is necessary, and the protest has been extended, the expenses of protest; b.in the case of a bill which has been dishonoured abroad, in lieu of the above damages, the holder may recover from the drawer or an endorser, and the drawer or http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR an endorser who has been compelled to pay the bill may recover from any party liable to him, the amount of the re- exchange with interest thereon until the time of payment; where by this Act interest may be recovered as damages, the interest may, if justice require it, be withheld wholly or in part, and where a bill is expressed to be payable with interest at a given rate, interest as damages may or may not be given at the same rate as interest proper. Held: 1.There was no need for the trial court to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the trial court just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the trial court to interrogate again in their judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. Therefore, there was no merit in that complaint and it was accordingly dismissed. 2.From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the representations before court, there was nothing before the trial court for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admitted they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the trial court was therefore entitled on the facts before it to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. Therefore, there was no merit in that complaint and it was accordingly dismissed. 3.There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. By reason http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated in section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act, denoted that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision had to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim was laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. 4.There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act. 5.The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the trial court to exercise its discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated that as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, nothing was wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the trial court when assessing damages payable in the instant matter. 6.The appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues was settled in that the object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given. 7.PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if the instant Court were to take it that that request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of those having been raised in the course of the trial, testified http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR upon and submission made thereof, the question was whether the trial court was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. It was not. 8.Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act provided that interest on damages assessed at large started running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arose. Therefore, there was no reason as to why the trial court should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and that stand was affirmed. 9.A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages. The trial court drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before it, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under that head where the claimant was not a trader, he was only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss had been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages had to be claimed as a special damage. The trial court also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to the client ( Mr. Ogwayo.) 10.The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. The client (Mr. Ogwayo) himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client was therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the trial court opined that in the circumstances of the facts before it, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR factored in damages for negligence. In the result, there was no fault in the trial court s discounting of the negligence as the court was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. 11.Special damages had to not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. 12.The appellant s claim was laid at large. Any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. By this was meant that the actual loss had to be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer ( Ogwayo) gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. That should have been tabulated and claimed as such. Therefore, there was no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. 13.Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negated anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. 14.Nominal damages can also be spoken of as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. Where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. 15.Applying the foregoing on normal damages; therefore, the appellant s claim did not fall into the category of claims that qualified for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonouring a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. 16.A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominaldamages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim fell outside the nominal damages bracket but with a caveat that any intended award of damages could not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then those should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court had no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. 17.The award to that firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. Appeal partially allowed. The award of 1 million (Kshs. 1,000,000.00)for injurious falsehood was affirmed but the award ofKshs.10, 000.00nominal damage was set aside and substituted it with an http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract.

No. 2410 of 1999) JUDGMENT OF THE COURT Introduction. The appellant Nyamogo and Nyamogo Advocates filed Nairobi High Court Civil suit number 2410 of 1999 against the respondent Barclays Bank (K) Limited. The plaint is dated and filed on the 16th day of December, 1999. The appellant s complaint was basically that on the 8th day of June, 1998, the appellant drew a cheque upon the respondent as its banker for Kshs.4,376,402.35 payable to Arthur William Ogwayo. On order in payment of a business debt due to the said Arthur William Ogwayo ; on or about the 3rd of June, 1998 the respondent failed to effect special clearance of the cheque out of which, to the knowledge of the respondent, funds were to be made available to the same Arthur William Ogwayo who was leaving on a business trip to Southern Africa and who had to leave without the money. By reason of matters complained of, the appellant suffered loss of a customer, loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In consequence thereof, the appellant claimed from the respondent General damages for breach of contract; for injurious falsehood; for libel and for negligence, costs and interests on the above. The respondent filed a statement of defence dated the 14th day of January, 2000 basically denying the entire claim. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR Thereafter, liability as against the respondent was settled by consent of the parties on the 15th day of May, 2000, vide which the respondent admitted liability for the wrongful dishonor of cheque. There followed a formal proof in which Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo and Arthur William Ogwayo were the only witnesses. Judgment of the High Court. Parties filed written submissions. P.J. Ransley, J in a brief judgment dated the 4th day of February, 2004 delivered himself inter alia thus:- As I have already said substantive damages can only be awarded under one head of damages; in this case for injurious falsehood. The damages for breach of contract I worked out now in all at Kshs.10,000.00. With regard to injurious false hood, I award a sum of Kshs. 1 million. There is evidence that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The plaintiff will have the costs of the suit and interests on the damages awarded from the date of this judgment. Grounds of appeal The appellant was aggrieved by that judgment and filed this appeal citing nine (9) grounds of appeal. These are that, the learned trial Judge erred both in law and in fact:- (1) In failing to make a finding with respect to the failure of the respondent to effect special clearance of a cheque after payment of their fees. (2) In making an award in respect of only the breach of contract by dishonor of the plaintiff s cheque and not in respect to the breach of contract by failing to effect special clearance of a cheque. (3) In considering a fact that was not proved before him by stating that there was evidence that the dishonoured cheque was eventually paid. (4) By failing to consider the provisions of the Bill of Exchange Act. (5) In failing to make an award for interest from the date of dishonor of the cheque and not date of judgment. (6) In failing to consider fully the decision relied on by the appellant s Advocates. (7) By holding that substantial damages can be awarded under one head of damages namely injuries falsehoods whereas particulars of damages were provided in the plaint and proved. (8) In failing to make an award in respect of special damages which were proved in evidence before him. (9) In awarding a nominal amount of only Kshs.10, 000.00 for breach of contract in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the plaintiff. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR (10) In consequence thereof, the appellant sought from this appellate court for the setting order of that judgment. The appellant s submissions The appellant urged us to fault the learned Judge s findings on the grounds that the learned trial Judge fell into an error when (i) he failed to apply clear principles of law stipulated in section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya which clearly stipulates that the amount of damages for breach of contract under this provision is the equivalent of the amount forming the dishonoured bill; (ii) when he erroneously awarded nominal damages for breach of contract as opposed to an award of substantial damages (iii) when he took into consideration extraneous unpleaded and un proven matters that the cheque was eventually paid and (iv) when he failed to make an award for special damages which had been pleaded and proved. Respondent s submissions. In response, the respondent urged us to affirm the learned trial Judge s decision and dismiss the appellant s appeal on the grounds that the learned trial judge properly directed his mind to factors favouring both and properly awarded damages for both; that the respondent admitted wrong doing and also overtly mitigated the damage caused to the appellant and his client and also apologized in unequivocal terms for the inconvenience the client suffered as a result of their erroneous action; that the libel reached only one person, the appellant s client; and lastly everything that could be done to protect the integrity of the appellant was done in the circumstances of this case. Turning to the quantum of damages awarded, it was the respondent s arguments that these fell within the threshold acceptable in law for an award of damages under those heads considering the guiding principle that assessment of damages is a matter of the exercise of the court s discretion. The respondent further urged us to find that no basis had been shown for us to interfere with the award of damages because the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the value of the dishonoured cheque of Kshs.4,376,402.35 as he never lost it; all that happened was that the client did not leave the country with the said amount on account of the error complained of; and the client was paid the value of the said cheque upon rectification of the error; to order the appellant to be paid the value of the dishonoured cheque would amount to an unjust enrichment to the appellant and for this reason Section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 laws of Kenya cannot be called into aid on special damages; that the appellant was not entitled to any award under the head of special damages as he neither pleaded nor specifically proved these. As for interest the respondent argued that the learned trial Judge was entitled to decline the appellant s oral request in his submissions to court for an award of interest at 30 because it was also not pleaded in the plaint; nor proved in evidence and therefore had no basis in law or and; it would have been manifestly excessive if it had been awarded. The correct position in law is that interest awarded on damages at large is usually ordered to run from the date of the award. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 14 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The respondent argued that the learned trial Judge properly appraised himself of the case law cited to him as borne out by the judgment and it mattered not that the learned trial Judge did not apply them to his reasoning in the manner requested by the appellant so long as there is proof on the record that they were indeed assessed by the learned trial Judge. The Appellant s Authorities. The appellant relied on the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society [1964] 4 ALLER 119 for the proposition that a person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit for business reputation resulting from a cheque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank; the case of Davidson versus Barclays Bank Limited [1940] 1 ALL ER 316 for the proposition that the defence of qualified privilege is not available to a bank where there was no matter of common interest connected with the cheque which called for communication in instances where the bank on its own made a mistake of thinking that there were insufficient funds to meet the cheque; the decision in the case of Plunkett and another versus Barclays Bank limited [1936] 1 ALL ER 653 for the proposition that the money standing to the credit of the client account was a debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff and the Garnishee order nisi binds that debt on the defendant s hands. Respondent s Authorities. The respondent on the other hand relied on the legal text of Ellinger s Modern Banking Law Fourth Edition (E.P.Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka , and Richard Hooley) Oxford University Press page 461 for the proposition that a wrongful dishonor of a cheque constitutes a breach of contract on the bank s part and in certain cases the customer may have an additional action in defamation; (ii) Any carelessly composed answer written on a dishonoured cheque is capable of being construed as defamation provided it is susceptible to such an interpretation by a reasonable man; Pagets Law of Banking Twelfth Edition Mark Hop Good QC Butter worth page 399 for the proposition that the credit of a customer may be seriously injured by the wrongful dishonour of a cheque, yet it is rare that a customer will be able to prove special damage. His claim is for general damages in respect of injury to his reputation. Turning to case law, there is reliance on the decision in the case of Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939] 3 ALLER 577 for the proposition that: A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonour of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as special damages ; the decision in the case of Mbogo and another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 for the proposition that a Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some matter and as a result arrived at a wrong decision , or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice. The decision in the case of Shiraku versus Commercial Bank of Africa [1988] KLR67. At page 75 this Court made observation thus:- http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 15 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR To wrongly dishonor any cheque is to do some injury in fact. If that is right then it is not necessary to plead and prove damages. But in ordinary circumstances, the damages will be quite modest. They will be more than nominal damages but not so great as to be excessive. ....... It is when the injury is pleaded and proved that damages of substantial amount will be made, but again they must not be excessive.... On the basis of the above observation the court went on to hold inter alia that:- A person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has suffered is alleged and proved as a special damage....... Lastly, there is the decision in the case of Salim another versus Kikaua [1988] KLR 534. In this case, this Court drew inspiration from the decision in the case of Premlata versus Peter Musa Mbiyu [1965] EA 592 and went on to hold inter alia that:- According to authorities, interest on general damages should be paid from the date of assessment which is the date of judgment. That is the earliest date when the defendant s liability to pay does arise. The Mandate of the Court. This is a first appeal and our mandate is to re-appraise; re-assess and re-analize the evidence on the record before us and arrive at our own conclusion on the matter and give reasons either way. See the case of Sumaria Another versus Allied Industries Limited [2007] 2KLR1 . The only caveat being that in the discharge of its aforesaid mandate, this Court should be slow in moving to interfere with a finding of fact by a trial court unless it was based on no evidence, it was based on a misapprehension of the evidence or the judge had been shown demonstrably to have acted on a wrong principle in reaching the finding he did. See also Musera versus Mwechelesi another [2007] 2KLR 159 . We have on our own in obedience to the above mandate revisited the record, re-assessed, re-evaluated and re-analyzed it in the light of the above rival arguments and are able to make the following determination in the appellant s complaints; Determination of issue No.1 On the facts as they were before the learned Judge, there was no need for the learned Judge to specifically mention the respondent s failure to so accord the said cheque special clearance as the respondent s failure to do so was part of the wrong doing for which the respondent admitted liability. It was in order for the learned judge just to note that liability had been admitted. There was therefore no obligation on the learned judge to interrogate again in his judgment the factual base forming the admission of liability. We find no merit in this complaint. The same is dismissed. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 16 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR Determination of issue No.2 The scanty evidence on this issue is what we have gleaned from the testimony on oath of Nyamodi Ochieng Nyamogo on behalf of the appellant. This is what he said:- As the client was leaving for South Africa he left without this cheque. He instructed me to pay the money to his wife and transfer to Swaziland. .... Received two replies. The letter of 24th June, 1998 admitted his error and apologized eventually we paid our client.... When cross examined by Mr. Majanja, PW1 had this response to make:- The cheque I do not know if it was represented. On the face of it, it was not represented. We paid Mr. Ogwayo the money. Mr. Authur William Ogwayo who gave evidence in the formal proof as PW2 had this to say:- I went and my trip reluctantly asked Mr. Nyamogo to pay the sum to my wife for onward transmission to me...... From the testimony of PW1 he was not sure whether the cheque had been represented or not. On the above representations there was nothing before the Judge for him to rule out the possibility of the cheque having been represented and paid. Second, PW1 admits they paid their client. There was however no mention that they eventually paid their client from other sources. In the premises, the learned trial Judge was therefore entitled on the facts before him to assume that payment to the appellant s client was made from the value of the same cheque that had previously been dishonoured. We find no merit in this complaint and it is accordingly dismissed. Determination of issue No.3 There was no specific pleading for the application of the provisions of section 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act Cap 27 Laws of Kenya in the appellant s plaint. The relevant portions of section 57 of the Act provides inter alia thus;- 57 where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages which shall be deemed to be liquidated damages shall be as follows...... http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 17 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By reason of the words shall be deemed to be liquidated denotes that any party wishing to avail itself of that provision has to lay its claim in the manner liquidated claim is laid, that is by being specifically pleading it with particulars, and then specifically proving it. There was no specific prayer by the appellant that the quantum of damages payable to them on account of the dishonoured cheque should be based on its value as stipulated by section 57 of the Bill of Exchange Act (supra). As mentioned, this arose in PW1 s testimony. It appears clearly that it arose from the conversation PW1 had with one Ojiambo of the respondent over the contents of a letter of 30 3 1999, that Mr. Ojiambo of Kaplan Stratton had written to PW1. The content of that correspondence is what formed the basis of the appellant s testimony in court when he made the oral request to the court that the measure of damages, payable to the appellant should be based on the value of the dishonoured cheque. The framing of the prayers in the plaint by the appellant left room for the learned judge to exercise his discretion in determining the measure of damages payable. Paragraph 5 of the plaint simply indicated this as the amount forming the dishonoured cheque. Paragraph 10 gave particulars of the loss with no particularization, whereas the reliefs in paragraph 15 were prayed for in general terms. In the result, we find nothing wrong in the mode of approach adopted by the learned trial judge when assessing damages payable herein. Determination of issue No.4 With regard to interest payable paragraph 15(e) of the appellant s prayer was for. (e) Costs and interest on the above. And the court awarded interest on damages awarded from the date of this judgment Section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act cap 21 Laws of Kenya provides: 26(1) Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the court may in the decree order interest at such rate as the court may deem reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged from the date of the suit to the date of the decree in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period before the institution of the suit with further interest at such rate as the court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged from the date of the decree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the court thinks fit. 2 .......... It was correctly submitted by the respondent that the appellant did not plead any specific measure of interest that he intended applied to any resulting figure that may be adjudged in their favour. The position in law on unpleaded issues has been crystallized by case law numerously pronounced by this Court. The http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 18 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR predecessor of this Court in the case of Captain Harry Gandy versus CAS Par Air Charters Limited [1956] Volume XXII EACA 139, Sinclair vice-president inter alia had this to observe at page 140 paragraph 3:- The object of pleadings is of course to ensure that both parties shall know what are the points in issue between them, so that each may have full information of the case he has to meet and prepare his evidence to support his own case or to meet that of his opponent. As a rule relief not founded on the pleadings will not be given.... After citing the decision of Scrutton L.J in Blay versus Pollard and Morris [1930] 1.K.B. 682- he added the following:- Cases must be decided on the issues on the record and if it is desired to raise other issues they must be placed on the record by amendment.... This position was approved and applied by the same predecessor of this Court in the decision in the case of Odd Jobs versus Mubia [1970] EA 476. Law, J.A (as he then was), at page 478 paragraph 9-11 had this to say:- On the point that a court has no jurisdiction to decree on an issue which has not been pleaded, the attitude adopted by this Court is not as strict as appears to be that of Courts in India. In East Africa the position is that a Court may allow evidence to be called and may base its decision on an unpleaded issue if it appears from the cause followed at the trial that the unpleaded issue has in fact been left to the court for decision.... PW1 in his testimony to court asked for interest at commercial rates. Even if this Court were to take it that this request removed the appellant s claim from the rule on strict compliance with ones pleadings and then placed it into the category of matters falling for the court s adjudication by virtue of these having been raised in the course of the trial, testified upon and submission made thereof, the question is whether the learned trial Judge was bound by PW1 s request for interest at commercial rate. He was not. In the case of Salim another versus Kikava (supra) this Court revisited and confirmed the provisions of section 26 of the Civil Procedure Act (supra) that interest on damages assessed at large starts running from the date of assessment as the date when liability arises. We find no reason as to why the learned trial judge should have departed from a path well beaten as regards awarding of interest on damages at large. The judge was right and we affirm that stand. Determination of issue number 5. The learned trial Judge specifically made reference in the body of the judgment to two of the authorities cites by the appellant remedy Timwood Products Limited versus Bank of Baroda (supra) and the decision in Kpohror versus Wool Wich Building Society (supra). The decision in Kpohror (supra) which is a 1996 decision simply re-echoed the principle earlier on enunciated in the earlier decision of Gibbons ( supra) that a person who is not a trader is not entitled to recover substantial damages for the wrongful dishonor of his cheque unless the damage which he has http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 19 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR suffered is alleged and proved as special damages; the decision of Davidson (supra ) simply disallowed the defence of qualified privilege where the bank of its own elects to engage in a communication on a matter of alleged common interest. Whereas in the Plunkett another case (supra) it simply stated inter alia that where the bank had satisfied a debt in obedience to a Garnishee order leaving insufficient funds in the clients account resulting in the cheque presented to the said account being referred to the drawer; the words refer to drawer in the circumstances were held not to be a libel. The learned trial Judge drew out general principles of law as applying to the matter before him, namely damages for breach of contract arising from claims based on a dishonoured cheques under this head where the claimant is not a trader, he is only entitled to nominal damages, where some loss has been occasioned to the claimant beyond nominal damages substantial damages has to be claimed as a special damage. The decision of Tim Wood properties case (supra) was distinguished by the learned Judge because the award of Kshs. 80,000.00 had been awarded as a special damage. The learned trial Judge also took into consideration the fact that the cheque was eventually paid to Mr. Ogwayo. The funds forming the dishonoured cheque were never meant for the benefit of the appellant. Mr. Ogwayo himself in his testimony said he had wanted to sever completely the client advocate relationship with the appellant but his wife, intervened and in fact he thereafter gave some business to the appellant after the incident subject to his appeal. The fact of total loss of client is therefore ruled out. On the basis of the above, the learned Judge opined that in the circumstances of the facts before him, the appellant could only recover under injurious falsehood. Damages for libel and negligence were discounted. None of the case law assessed above was shown to have factored in damages for negligence. In fact, in the appellant s own authority of Plunkett and another (supra), the holding is inter alia that word refer to drawer , does not amount to libel . In the result, we find no fault in the learned trial Judge s discounting of the negligence as he was within the principles of case law assessed and applied by him. Determination of issue No.6 The complaint on failure to award substantial damages is related to the complaint against the award of nominal damages and will therefore be dealt with together. Determination of issue No.7 This relates to the complaint on the learned trial judge s failure to make provision for an award of special damages. Shiraku case (supra) is explicit on this, that such loss must be alleged and proved as a special damage. See also the case of Hann versus Singh [1985] KLR 716 for the proposition that special damages must not only be specifically claimed but also strictly proved. The appellant failed to do so. Determination of issue number 8. The head of loss of credit received an award of K shs.1, 000,000.00 , while the head for breach of contract attracted an award of nominal damages of only Kshs.10, 000.00. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 20 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR The principles that guide this Court in determining whether to interfere or not to intervene in the superior court s exercise of discretion on the assessment of damages and why now form a well trodden path. Sir Charles New Bold P. in the case of Mbogo another versus Shah [1968] EA 93 at page 96 paragraph G-H had this to say:- For myself, I like to put it in the words that a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that the judge in exercising his discretion misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge has been clearly wrong in the exercise of that discretion and that as a result there had been misjustice See also the reiteration of this principle by this Court in the decision in the case of Butler versus Butler [1984] KLR 225 wherein it was held inter alia that:- The assessment of damages is more like an exercise of discretion by the trial judge and an appellate court should be slow to reverse the trial judge unless he has either acted on wrong principles or awarded so excessive or so little damages that no reasonable court would; or he has taken into consideration matters he ought not to have considered, and in the result arrived at a wrong decision. In addition to the above principles learned counsel for the respondent drew the Court s attention to the provisions of section 16A (1) of the Defamation Act cap 36 laws of Kenya. It provided:- In any action for libel the court shall assess the amount of damages payable in such amount as it may deem just. Provided that where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by death, the amount assessed shall not be less than one million shillings, and where the libel is in respect of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years the amount assessed shall not be less than four hundred thousand shillings The appellant s claim as set out in the plaint on the record is basically that by reason of matters averred to therein the appellant suffered loss of a customer; loss of credit and reputation and loss of business. In paragraph 11, 12, 13 the appellant averred thus:- 11. The plaintiff aver and will prove at the hearing hereof that the defendant s actions were calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in their trade. 12. By reason of the matters aforesaid, the plaintiff has been seriously injured and suffered general loss on their said business. 13. The plaintiff further averred and will prove at the hearing hereof that by the malicious publication of the said words on the face of the cheque, the plaintiff has been greatly injured in its credit, reputation and has been brought into a scandal Odium and contempt All the above averments indicate that the appellant s claim was laid at large. The case law assessed above indicates that any claim beyond the injury to reputation had to be pleaded as a special damage. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 21 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR By this was meant that the actual loss should be calculated and claimed. The fact that the customer Ogwayo gave away to other advocates some of the briefs which should have been monopolized by the appellant though admitted in the oral testimony of PW1 and PW2 was not enough to quantify and prove the actual loss. This should have been tabulated and claimed as such. We find no merit in the appellant s complaint that an award for substantial damages should have been made in his favour. As for nominal damages, in the decision in Gibbons versus West Minister Bank Limited [1939]3ALLER 577 , It was held inter alia that The plaintiff not being a trader was entitled only to nominal damages in respect of the wrongful dishonor of a cheque by her bank. Grabbe JA. in the case of Kanji Naran Patel versus Noor Essa and another [1965]EA484 at page 487 paragraph G-I had this to say:- Nominal damage is a technical phrase which means that you have negatived anything like real damage, but that you are affirming by your nominal damages that there is an infraction of a legal right which, though it gives you no right to any real damages at all, yet gives you a right to the verdict or judgment because your legal right has been infringed. But the term nominal damage does not mean small damages. The extent to which a person has a right to recover what is called by the compendious phrase damages but may also be represented as compensation for the use of something that belongs to him, depends upon a variety of circumstances and it certainly does not in the smallest degree suggest that because they are small, they are necessarily nominal damages. In the earlier case of Beumont versus Great head [1846] 2C.B. 494, Maule, J. [1846] 2C.B. at P.499) spoke of nominal damages as a sum that may be spoken of but that has not existence in point of quantity and as a mere peg on which to hang costs. In Kimakia Co-Operative Society versus Green Hotel [1988] KLR 242, this Court held inter alia that where damages are at large and cannot be quantified, the court may have to assess damages upon some conventional yardstick. But if a specific loss is to be compensated and the party was given a chance to prove the loss and he did not he cannot have more than nominal damages. Applying the above to the rival arguments herein on normal damages, we are of the view that the appellant s claim does not fall into the category of claims that qualify for nominal damages only because the appellant was not merely seeking to negative a right but was saying that by the reason of his professional standing as a firm of advocates dishonor a cheque payable on its behalf had repercussion on their professional standing. Authority for this is the decision in the case of Kpohror versus Woolwich Building Society (supra) wherein it was held inter alia that: A person who was not a trader could recover substantial rather than nominal damages in contract for loss of credit or business reputation resulting from a chaque being wrongly dishonoured by his bank ; In Gibsons case (supra) and the Shiraku case (supra) nominal damages were awarded because the claimants were not trading. The appellant was trading as a firm of advocates. They were therefore in business. Their claim falls outside the nominal damages bracket but with a http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 22 24 Nyamogo Nyamogo Advocates v Barclays Bank of Kenya [2015] eKLR caveat that any intended award of damages, should not be so high because if alleged heavy losses were involved then these should have been quantified and claimed as special damages. The court has no quarrel with the appellant s assertion that the reputation of the appellant as a professional firm of advocates meant everything. But we also wish to add that as observed elsewhere damage to the reputation of this firm was minimized by matters in controversy being confined to the appellant, the respondent and the appellant s then affected client. The award to that a firm of advocates with capacity to handle briefs worth millions should have been something beyond nominal damage, but not so high considering the other head of damages was also related to this head. We would award Kshs. 500,000.00 . In the result, we partially allow the appeal. We affirm the award of 1 million ( Kshs. 1,000,000.00) for injurious falsehood but set aside the award of Kshs.10, 000.00 nominal damage and substitute it with an award of Kshs.500, 000.00 as damages for breach of contract. The appellant will have half the costs of this appeal. Dated and Delivered at Nairobi this 8th day of May, 2015. R.N. NAMBUYE ................................................... JUDGE OF APPEAL P.O.

M. Mbati (Mrs.) delivered on the 21st\nFebruary, 2018 in Nairobi Children’s Case No. 698 of 2017 )\nJUDGMENT\n1. In a judgment dated 21st February, 2018 the Children Court at Nairobi in Case No. 698 of 2017 made orders directing that the\ndefendant pay in the first instance Kshs. 132,500/= towards the school fees needs of the plaintiff and that the mother do provide for\nall other school related expenses because parental responsibility is shared.\n2. Aggrieved by the decision, the defendant, who is the Appellant herein, approached the court by way of a memorandum of appeal\ndated 27th February, 2019 and filed on 20th June, 2018. The Appellant is asking the court to set aside the judgment and order of the\nChildren’s Court given on 21st February, 2018, and condemn the Respondent to pay the costs of this appeal.\n3. The Appellant advanced twelve (12) grounds of appeal the gist of which is that the honorable learned magistrate erred in law and\nin fact by allowing the suit filed by the Respondent for extension of parental responsibility whereas:\n1. The Respondent had confirmed during the hearing of the matter that the admission letter to East African Institute of Certified\nStudies, Nairobi produced as an exhibit in the case had lapsed and her place in the said college was no longer available.\n2. The Respondent had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability as expected in civil proceedings as she failed to produce\nher Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) to confirm that parental responsibility could be extended beyond eighteen\n(18) years by virtue of her qualification for admission to an institution of higher learning.\n3. It was evident from the Appellant’s net salary as exhibited in his pay slip that he could not afford to pay Kshs. 132,500/= towards\nthe Respondent’s college fees. Further that no evidence was presented to support the holding that even though the Appellant was\nstraining financially, he had other alternative sources of income to support the Respondent’s school needs.\n4. The Respondent had failed to demonstrate the special circumstances envisaged under section 28(1)  of the Children Act  with\nregard to the welfare of the child to warrant an order for extension of parental responsibility. Instead, the learned magistrate\nmisconstrued the law and held that regardless of the circumstances, once paternity is proved, extension of parental responsibility\nwould be a matter of natural course.\n5. The Respondent has been out of school for four (4) years and is engaged in personal income generating undertakings, modeling\nand marketing, which she admitted to during her evidence in court.\n6. The Respondent’s mother had elected to disown the Appellant as admitted by the Respondent in her evidence and the Appellant\ntherefore organized his life and financial needs as circumstances would dictate, including acquisition of loans. That there is\ntherefore nothing sinister about the said loans because it is the Respondent who elected to sit on her rights.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/7\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\n4. The appeal came up for directions on 24th January, 2019 where upon application by counsel for the Respondent the court directed\nthat the appeal be disposed of by way of written submissions. The matter had initially been referred to mediation but the parties\nfailed to reach a settlement as indicated in the Mediator’s Report dated 6th November, 2018.\n5. Learned Counsel Mr. Sumba filed written submissions dated 4th February, 2019 on behalf of the Appellant in which he reiterated\nthe grounds of the appeal and asked the court to allow the appeal in the terms prayed. Counsel urged that extension of parental\nresponsibility cannot be conferred to the Respondent without proof that she qualified to join an institution of higher learning.\nFurther that the Appellant’s resources are not sufficient to cater for his five (5) children and still pay for the Respondent’s college\nfees.\n6. Mr. Sumba asserted that the Respondent’s application in the Children’s Court was premised on section 28(1) of the Children\nAct which required that the Respondent demonstrate exceptional circumstances for parental responsibility to be extended but this\nwas not discharged. Counsel stated that the Respondent failed to exhibit a certificate for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education\nto demonstrate that she qualified to join college. Further that she had been out of school for a period of four (4) years and was in\ngainful employment. That in any event, the copy of the letter of admission had already lapsed even at the time the court held that\nfees be paid.\n7. In opposition, learned counsel Mr. Seth Ojienda filed written submissions dated 25th March, 2019 on behalf of the Respondent in\nwhich he submitted that it is in the best interest of the of the Respondent that the court sustain the lower court judgment and decree.\n8. It is Mr. Ojienda’s submission that the Respondent approached the Children’s Court seeking extension of parental responsibility\nagainst the Appellant since she had secured admission to pursue a diploma in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of\nCertified Studies but could not raise the fees of Kshs. 132,500/=. This prompted her to file the application since the Appellant, her\nbiological father, had the means to pay for her tertiary education.\n9. Mr. Ojienda submitted that parental responsibility is automatic and self-activating on parents upon the birth of a child and fathers\ncannot have the discretion of either rejecting or accepting that responsibility. That the fact that the Appellant failed to participate in\nthe general upbringing of the Respondent does not absolve him from exercising parental responsibility over her.\n10. Counsel asserted that section 28  of the Children Act provides that parental responsibility in respect of a child beyond the age of\neighteen years can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That\nsection 91  of the Children Act further provides for circumstances under which a person who is not a child can apply to the court for\na maintenance order.\n11. Mr. Ojienda submitted that the  Children Act  defines education to mean the giving of intellectual, moral, spiritual instruction or\nother training to a child. Counsel asserted that basic education is more than just learning how to read, write and calculate. It\nencompasses the broadest possible sense of learning at any stage of life and it is not confined to childhood and formative years.\nCounsel stated that the court has power to extend the right to education to a child of over eighteen (18) years if the court is satisfied\nupon application or on its own motion that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That in the instant\ncase, the special circumstance was that the Respondent required the Applicant to pay for her college fees.\n12. Counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of the Kenyan education system where a child starts school at the age of 6 years\nand remains reliant upon their parents for school fees, university or college fees beyond the age of eighteen (18) years. That it is the\nRespondent’s desperation to pursue higher education that made her file the suit before the lower court.\n13. It is Mr. Ojienda’s submission that even though the Respondent is a child born out of wedlock, Article 53  of the Constitution\nand the Children Act provide for the principles of equality and non-discrimination of legimate and illegitimate children. Counsel\nasserted that the Appellant has children from his current marriage for whom he is able and willing to provide for including payment\nof school fees for higher education.\n14. Mr. Ojienda noted that the Appellant has a daughter one MDA who is pursuing an undergraduate program in Education (Arts) at\n[Particulars withheld] University for whom he pays a total of one hundred and twenty six thousand shillings (Kshs. 126,000/=) per\nacademic year. That the Respondent’s reluctance to cater for the Respondent’s school fees to pursue a diploma in journalism\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/7\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\ntherefore amounts to discrimination. Counsel urged that the Appellant being able to afford school fees for his children within the\nmarriage set up is compelled by law to provide for the Respondent albeit born out of wedlock.\n15. The court has considered the grounds of appeal, the various authorities referred to by both counsels on record and their rival\narguments to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the orders for extension of parental\nresponsibility against the Appellant. This court is alive to the fact that it did not hear the witnesses testify or observe their demeanor,\nand therefore should be slow to reverse the trial court’s decision. It is however, not lost on this court that an appeal is in a way a\nretrial. It therefore must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions. In the case of Peters vs. Sunday\nPosts Ltd [1958] E.A. 424  at page 429, the Court of Appeal rendered itself thus:\n“It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the finding, on a question of fact, of the Judge who tried the case,\nand who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. An appellate court has, indeed, jurisdiction to review the\nevidence in order to determine whether the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand. But this is a\njurisdiction which should be exercised with caution, it is not enough that the appellate court might itself have come to a\ndifferent conclusion.”\n16. Parental responsibility is defined under PART III, section 23(1) of the Children Act to mean all the duties, rights, powers,\nresponsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child. The child envisaged under the Children\nAct is any human being who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. It is noteworthy however that parental responsibility in respect\nof a child who has attained the age of majority can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to\nthe welfare of the child. The special circumstances are provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act which stipulates thus:\n“Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child’s eighteenth\nbirthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the\nwelfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made:\nProvided that the order may be applied for after the child’s eighteenth birthday.”\n17. Section 91(b)  of the Children Act further provides for exceptional circumstances when a person who is not a child can apply to\nthe court for a maintenance order. The section states thus:\n“Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the\nmaintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the\nmaintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a “maintenance order,” as the court may see fit;\nProvided that-\n(a)…\n(b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance\norder to be made in his favor in the following circumstances-\n(i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or\n(ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person’s eighteenth birthday; or\n(iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person’s\neighteenth birthday; or\n(iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order.”\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/7\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\n18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the\nfact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently\npursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs.\n130,000/= per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children’s education is attributable to the fact that he has been\npresent in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education.\n19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until\nafter she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children’s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th\nFebruary, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld]\nInstitute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent’s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now\nstates is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education.\n20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at\n[Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course\nduration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016/2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th\nMay, 2017 the 2016/2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled\nfor the program.  There is also no copy of the Respondent’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her\nqualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education.\n21. The Appellant’s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of\ninstituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the\nRespondent’s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought\nmeant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education.\n22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where\nthere has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the\nRespondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend\nfor herself and cater for her further education.\n23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the\nAppellant’s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the\nRespondent’s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state “ it\nis common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an\nalternative source of income which he did not disclose. ” Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September,\n2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was\nhowever no evidence of the Appellant’s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income.\n24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than\nchildren born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also\nstruggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to\nextend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent’s diploma course.\n25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination\nhowever is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders\nthat were granted in the lower court.\n26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental\nresponsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary\nEducation, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education.\n27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18)\nyears, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to\ncompel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental\nresponsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See – Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/7\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\nWaiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ).\n28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary\nschool education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the\nAppellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the\nAppellant has never contributed towards the Respondent’s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or\nomissions.\n29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant’s doing to be out of the Respondent’s life. In her\nexamination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had\ncompleted her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross-\nexamination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to\nstate:\n“He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for\nmy father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I\ndidn’t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. ”\n30. From the Respondent’s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years\npost-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the\ntime of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school\neducation. It therefore appears that the Respondent’s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by\nthe Respondent’s interaction with the Appellant’s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross-\nexamination told the trial court “… My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook…I want the Defendant to pay Kshs.\n132,000/- per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000/- per year. The Defendant’s children are in public universities. ”\n31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to\n[Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part\nof the Respondent’s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows:\n“My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don’t talk about\nfees with my step sister.\nCourt: Is your admission to M still available\"\nPlaintiff: No. I wouldn’t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July.\nCourt: If you go back will they take you\"\nPlaintiff: Yes it was a diploma.\nCourt: What did you get in KCSE\"\nPlaintiff: A C plain. ”\n32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She\nalluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her\nadmission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU.\nShe did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all\nthe Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in\nmind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/7\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nCM v SWA [2019] eKLR\n33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the\nRespondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to\ncompel the Appellant to cater for.\n34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of\nmajority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent’s tertiary education. This is because he has\nalways been aware of the existence of his other children and therefore planned for their needs, unlike the Respondent herein. In any\nevent, the Respondent is an adult who can seek employment and cater for her own college fees. Further, in the instant case, the\nRespondent failed to smoothly transition into tertiary education and is not certain of where she wants to pursue her tertiary\neducation.\n35. In the end, I find that the Respondent is not deserving of the orders extending parental responsibility against the Appellant. The\nresult is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is consequently allowed. The judgment and order of the Children Court at\nNairobi made on 21st February, 2018 is hereby set aside forthwith. Based on the nature of this appeal, each party shall bear their\nown costs.

RESPONDENT (Being an appeal from the judgment and decree of the Honorable Resident Magistrate H. M. Mbati (Mrs.) delivered on the 21st February, 2018 in Nairobi Children s Case No. 698 of 2017 ) JUDGMENT 1. In a judgment dated 21st February, 2018 the Children Court at Nairobi in Case No. 698 of 2017 made orders directing that the defendant pay in the first instance Kshs. 132,500 towards the school fees needs of the plaintiff and that the mother do provide for all other school related expenses because parental responsibility is shared. 2. Aggrieved by the decision, the defendant, who is the Appellant herein, approached the court by way of a memorandum of appeal dated 27th February, 2019 and filed on 20th June, 2018. The Appellant is asking the court to set aside the judgment and order of the Children s Court given on 21st February, 2018, and condemn the Respondent to pay the costs of this appeal. 3. The Appellant advanced twelve (12) grounds of appeal the gist of which is that the honorable learned magistrate erred in law and in fact by allowing the suit filed by the Respondent for extension of parental responsibility whereas: 1. The Respondent had confirmed during the hearing of the matter that the admission letter to East African Institute of Certified Studies, Nairobi produced as an exhibit in the case had lapsed and her place in the said college was no longer available. 2. The Respondent had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability as expected in civil proceedings as she failed to produce her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) to confirm that parental responsibility could be extended beyond eighteen (18) years by virtue of her qualification for admission to an institution of higher learning. 3. It was evident from the Appellant s net salary as exhibited in his pay slip that he could not afford to pay Kshs. 132,500 towards the Respondent s college fees. Further that no evidence was presented to support the holding that even though the Appellant was straining financially, he had other alternative sources of income to support the Respondent s school needs. 4. The Respondent had failed to demonstrate the special circumstances envisaged under section 28(1) of the Children Act with regard to the welfare of the child to warrant an order for extension of parental responsibility. Instead, the learned magistrate misconstrued the law and held that regardless of the circumstances, once paternity is proved, extension of parental responsibility would be a matter of natural course. 5. The Respondent has been out of school for four (4) years and is engaged in personal income generating undertakings, modeling and marketing, which she admitted to during her evidence in court. 6. The Respondent s mother had elected to disown the Appellant as admitted by the Respondent in her evidence and the Appellant therefore organized his life and financial needs as circumstances would dictate, including acquisition of loans. That there is therefore nothing sinister about the said loans because it is the Respondent who elected to sit on her rights. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 4. The appeal came up for directions on 24th January, 2019 where upon application by counsel for the Respondent the court directed that the appeal be disposed of by way of written submissions. The matter had initially been referred to mediation but the parties failed to reach a settlement as indicated in the Mediator s Report dated 6th November, 2018. 5. Learned Counsel Mr. Sumba filed written submissions dated 4th February, 2019 on behalf of the Appellant in which he reiterated the grounds of the appeal and asked the court to allow the appeal in the terms prayed. Counsel urged that extension of parental responsibility cannot be conferred to the Respondent without proof that she qualified to join an institution of higher learning. Further that the Appellant s resources are not sufficient to cater for his five (5) children and still pay for the Respondent s college fees. 6. Mr. Sumba asserted that the Respondent s application in the Children s Court was premised on section 28(1) of the Children Act which required that the Respondent demonstrate exceptional circumstances for parental responsibility to be extended but this was not discharged. Counsel stated that the Respondent failed to exhibit a certificate for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate that she qualified to join college. Further that she had been out of school for a period of four (4) years and was in gainful employment. That in any event, the copy of the letter of admission had already lapsed even at the time the court held that fees be paid. 7. In opposition, learned counsel Mr. Seth Ojienda filed written submissions dated 25th March, 2019 on behalf of the Respondent in which he submitted that it is in the best interest of the of the Respondent that the court sustain the lower court judgment and decree. 8. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that the Respondent approached the Children s Court seeking extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant since she had secured admission to pursue a diploma in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies but could not raise the fees of Kshs. 132,500 . This prompted her to file the application since the Appellant, her biological father, had the means to pay for her tertiary education. 9. Mr. Ojienda submitted that parental responsibility is automatic and self-activating on parents upon the birth of a child and fathers cannot have the discretion of either rejecting or accepting that responsibility. That the fact that the Appellant failed to participate in the general upbringing of the Respondent does not absolve him from exercising parental responsibility over her. 10. Counsel asserted that section 28 of the Children Act provides that parental responsibility in respect of a child beyond the age of eighteen years can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That section 91 of the Children Act further provides for circumstances under which a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. 11. Mr. Ojienda submitted that the Children Act defines education to mean the giving of intellectual, moral, spiritual instruction or other training to a child. Counsel asserted that basic education is more than just learning how to read, write and calculate. It encompasses the broadest possible sense of learning at any stage of life and it is not confined to childhood and formative years. Counsel stated that the court has power to extend the right to education to a child of over eighteen (18) years if the court is satisfied upon application or on its own motion that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That in the instant case, the special circumstance was that the Respondent required the Applicant to pay for her college fees. 12. Counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of the Kenyan education system where a child starts school at the age of 6 years and remains reliant upon their parents for school fees, university or college fees beyond the age of eighteen (18) years. That it is the Respondent s desperation to pursue higher education that made her file the suit before the lower court. 13. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that even though the Respondent is a child born out of wedlock, Article 53 of the Constitution and the Children Act provide for the principles of equality and non-discrimination of legimate and illegitimate children. Counsel asserted that the Appellant has children from his current marriage for whom he is able and willing to provide for including payment of school fees for higher education. 14. Mr. Ojienda noted that the Appellant has a daughter one MDA who is pursuing an undergraduate program in Education (Arts) at [Particulars withheld] University for whom he pays a total of one hundred and twenty six thousand shillings (Kshs. 126,000 ) per academic year. That the Respondent s reluctance to cater for the Respondent s school fees to pursue a diploma in journalism http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR therefore amounts to discrimination. Counsel urged that the Appellant being able to afford school fees for his children within the marriage set up is compelled by law to provide for the Respondent albeit born out of wedlock. 15. The court has considered the grounds of appeal, the various authorities referred to by both counsels on record and their rival arguments to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. This court is alive to the fact that it did not hear the witnesses testify or observe their demeanor, and therefore should be slow to reverse the trial court s decision. It is however, not lost on this court that an appeal is in a way a retrial. It therefore must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions. In the case of Peters vs. Sunday Posts Ltd [1958] E.A. 424 at page 429, the Court of Appeal rendered itself thus: It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the finding, on a question of fact, of the Judge who tried the case, and who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. An appellate court has, indeed, jurisdiction to review the evidence in order to determine whether the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand. But this is a jurisdiction which should be exercised with caution, it is not enough that the appellate court might itself have come to a different conclusion. 16. Parental responsibility is defined under PART III, section 23(1) of the Children Act to mean all the duties, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child. The child envisaged under the Children Act is any human being who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. It is noteworthy however that parental responsibility in respect of a child who has attained the age of majority can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances are provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act which stipulates thus: Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child s eighteenth birthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made: Provided that the order may be applied for after the child s eighteenth birthday. 17. Section 91(b) of the Children Act further provides for exceptional circumstances when a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. The section states thus: Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the maintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a maintenance order, as the court may see fit; Provided that- (a) (b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance order to be made in his favor in the following circumstances- (i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the fact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs. 130,000 per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children s education is attributable to the fact that he has been present in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education. 19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until after she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th February, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now states is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education. 20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course duration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016 2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th May, 2017 the 2016 2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled for the program. There is also no copy of the Respondent s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her qualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education. 21. The Appellant s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of instituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the Respondent s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought meant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education. 22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where there has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the Respondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend for herself and cater for her further education. 23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the Appellant s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the Respondent s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state it is common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an alternative source of income which he did not disclose. Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September, 2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was however no evidence of the Appellant s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income. 24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than children born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also struggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to extend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent s diploma course. 25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination however is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders that were granted in the lower court. 26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education. 27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18) years, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to compel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental responsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR Waiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ). 28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary school education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the Appellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the Appellant has never contributed towards the Respondent s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or omissions. 29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant s doing to be out of the Respondent s life. In her examination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had completed her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross- examination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to state: He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for my father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I didn t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. 30. From the Respondent s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years post-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the time of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school education. It therefore appears that the Respondent s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by the Respondent s interaction with the Appellant s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross- examination told the trial court My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook I want the Defendant to pay Kshs. 132,000 - per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000 - per year. The Defendant s children are in public universities. 31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part of the Respondent s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows: My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don t talk about fees with my step sister. Court: Is your admission to M still available\" Plaintiff: No. I wouldn t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July. Court: If you go back will they take you\" Plaintiff: Yes it was a diploma. Court: What did you get in KCSE\" Plaintiff: A C plain. 32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She alluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her admission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU. She did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all the Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in mind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the Respondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to compel the Appellant to cater for. 34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of majority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent s tertiary education.

In a judgment dated 21st February, 2018 the Children Court at Nairobi in Case No. 698 of 2017 made orders directing that the defendant pay in the first instance Kshs. 132,500 towards the school fees needs of the plaintiff and that the mother do provide for all other school related expenses because parental responsibility is shared. 2.

The Respondent had failed to prove her case on a balance of probability as expected in civil proceedings as she failed to produce her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) to confirm that parental responsibility could be extended beyond eighteen (18) years by virtue of her qualification for admission to an institution of higher learning. 3. It was evident from the Appellant s net salary as exhibited in his pay slip that he could not afford to pay Kshs. 132,500 towards the Respondent s college fees. Further that no evidence was presented to support the holding that even though the Appellant was straining financially, he had other alternative sources of income to support the Respondent s school needs. 4. The Respondent had failed to demonstrate the special circumstances envisaged under section 28(1) of the Children Act with regard to the welfare of the child to warrant an order for extension of parental responsibility. Instead, the learned magistrate misconstrued the law and held that regardless of the circumstances, once paternity is proved, extension of parental responsibility would be a matter of natural course. 5. The Respondent has been out of school for four (4) years and is engaged in personal income generating undertakings, modeling and marketing, which she admitted to during her evidence in court. 6. The Respondent s mother had elected to disown the Appellant as admitted by the Respondent in her evidence and the Appellant therefore organized his life and financial needs as circumstances would dictate, including acquisition of loans. That there is therefore nothing sinister about the said loans because it is the Respondent who elected to sit on her rights. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 4. The appeal came up for directions on 24th January, 2019 where upon application by counsel for the Respondent the court directed that the appeal be disposed of by way of written submissions. The matter had initially been referred to mediation but the parties failed to reach a settlement as indicated in the Mediator s Report dated 6th November, 2018. 5. Learned Counsel Mr. Sumba filed written submissions dated 4th February, 2019 on behalf of the Appellant in which he reiterated the grounds of the appeal and asked the court to allow the appeal in the terms prayed. Counsel urged that extension of parental responsibility cannot be conferred to the Respondent without proof that she qualified to join an institution of higher learning. Further that the Appellant s resources are not sufficient to cater for his five (5) children and still pay for the Respondent s college fees. 6. Mr. Sumba asserted that the Respondent s application in the Children s Court was premised on section 28(1) of the Children Act which required that the Respondent demonstrate exceptional circumstances for parental responsibility to be extended but this was not discharged. Counsel stated that the Respondent failed to exhibit a certificate for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate that she qualified to join college. Further that she had been out of school for a period of four (4) years and was in gainful employment. That in any event, the copy of the letter of admission had already lapsed even at the time the court held that fees be paid. 7. In opposition, learned counsel Mr. Seth Ojienda filed written submissions dated 25th March, 2019 on behalf of the Respondent in which he submitted that it is in the best interest of the of the Respondent that the court sustain the lower court judgment and decree. 8. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that the Respondent approached the Children s Court seeking extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant since she had secured admission to pursue a diploma in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies but could not raise the fees of Kshs. 132,500 . This prompted her to file the application since the Appellant, her biological father, had the means to pay for her tertiary education. 9. Mr. Ojienda submitted that parental responsibility is automatic and self-activating on parents upon the birth of a child and fathers cannot have the discretion of either rejecting or accepting that responsibility. That the fact that the Appellant failed to participate in the general upbringing of the Respondent does not absolve him from exercising parental responsibility over her. 10. Counsel asserted that section 28 of the Children Act provides that parental responsibility in respect of a child beyond the age of eighteen years can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That section 91 of the Children Act further provides for circumstances under which a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. 11. Mr. Ojienda submitted that the Children Act defines education to mean the giving of intellectual, moral, spiritual instruction or other training to a child. Counsel asserted that basic education is more than just learning how to read, write and calculate. It encompasses the broadest possible sense of learning at any stage of life and it is not confined to childhood and formative years. Counsel stated that the court has power to extend the right to education to a child of over eighteen (18) years if the court is satisfied upon application or on its own motion that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. That in the instant case, the special circumstance was that the Respondent required the Applicant to pay for her college fees. 12. Counsel asked the court to take judicial notice of the Kenyan education system where a child starts school at the age of 6 years and remains reliant upon their parents for school fees, university or college fees beyond the age of eighteen (18) years. That it is the Respondent s desperation to pursue higher education that made her file the suit before the lower court. 13. It is Mr. Ojienda s submission that even though the Respondent is a child born out of wedlock, Article 53 of the Constitution and the Children Act provide for the principles of equality and non-discrimination of legimate and illegitimate children. Counsel asserted that the Appellant has children from his current marriage for whom he is able and willing to provide for including payment of school fees for higher education. 14. Mr. Ojienda noted that the Appellant has a daughter one MDA who is pursuing an undergraduate program in Education (Arts) at [Particulars withheld] University for whom he pays a total of one hundred and twenty six thousand shillings (Kshs. 126,000 ) per academic year. That the Respondent s reluctance to cater for the Respondent s school fees to pursue a diploma in journalism http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR therefore amounts to discrimination. Counsel urged that the Appellant being able to afford school fees for his children within the marriage set up is compelled by law to provide for the Respondent albeit born out of wedlock. 15. The court has considered the grounds of appeal, the various authorities referred to by both counsels on record and their rival arguments to determine whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. This court is alive to the fact that it did not hear the witnesses testify or observe their demeanor, and therefore should be slow to reverse the trial court s decision. It is however, not lost on this court that an appeal is in a way a retrial. It therefore must reconsider the evidence, evaluate it itself and draw its own conclusions. In the case of Peters vs. Sunday Posts Ltd [1958] E.A. 424 at page 429, the Court of Appeal rendered itself thus: It is a strong thing for an appellate court to differ from the finding, on a question of fact, of the Judge who tried the case, and who had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. An appellate court has, indeed, jurisdiction to review the evidence in order to determine whether the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand. But this is a jurisdiction which should be exercised with caution, it is not enough that the appellate court might itself have come to a different conclusion. 16. Parental responsibility is defined under PART III, section 23(1) of the Children Act to mean all the duties, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child. The child envisaged under the Children Act is any human being who is under the age of eighteen (18) years. It is noteworthy however that parental responsibility in respect of a child who has attained the age of majority can be extended if the court is satisfied that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances are provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act which stipulates thus: Parental responsibility in respect of a child may be extended by the court beyond the date of the child s eighteenth birthday if the court is satisfied upon application or of its own motion, that special circumstances exist with regard to the welfare of the child that would necessitate such extension being made: Provided that the order may be applied for after the child s eighteenth birthday. 17. Section 91(b) of the Children Act further provides for exceptional circumstances when a person who is not a child can apply to the court for a maintenance order. The section states thus: Any parent, guardian or custodian, of the child, may apply to the court to determine any matter relating to the maintenance of the child and to make an order that a specified person make such periodical or lump sum payment for the maintenance of a child, in this Act referred to as a maintenance order, as the court may see fit; Provided that- (a) (b) a person who has attained the age of eighteen years may, with the leave of the court, apply to the court for maintenance order to be made in his favor in the following circumstances- (i) the person is or will be involved in education and training which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (ii) the person is disabled and requires specialized care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iii) the person is suffering from an illness or ailment and will require medical care which will extend beyond the person s eighteenth birthday; or (iv) other special circumstances exist which would warrant the making of the order. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 18. There is no doubt that the Appellant values education as demonstrated by the caliber of schools his other children attend and the fact that he has also gone out of his way to support one of his children beyond the age of majority, one DM who is currently pursuing a Bachelors of Education degree under a parallel program at [Particulars withheld] University for a sum of Kshs. 130,000 per academic year. The fact that he caters for his other children s education is attributable to the fact that he has been present in their lives all through and had therefore planned for them and their education. 19. From the record, it is not in dispute that the Respondent is the daughter of the Appellant who has been absent from her life until after she attained the age of majority. At the time of filing the suit in the Children s Court, the Respondent who was born on 19th February, 1996 was aged 21 years and had secured admission to pursue a diploma course in journalism at the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. All through the Respondent s life, she was maintained solely by her mother who the Respondent now states is financially constrained and cannot meet the costs of her tertiary education. 20. There is on record a copy of an admission letter and fee structure for the Respondent to pursue a diploma course in journalism at [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies. The admission letter is dated 7th April, 2016 and indicates that the course duration is eighteen (18) months. The annexed fee structure is for the academic year 2016 2017. At the time of filing the suit on 24th May, 2017 the 2016 2017 academic year had commenced and there is nothing on the record to show that the Respondent enrolled for the program. There is also no copy of the Respondent s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to demonstrate her qualifications and whether she qualified for admission into college for furtherance of her education. 21. The Appellant s case is that the Respondent slept on her rights and was coming into his life a little too late, since at the time of instituting suit, four (4) years had lapsed since she sat for her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. That the Respondent s seamless transition from secondary school to university had therefore lapsed and that the suit was an afterthought meant to enable the Respondent accomplish a lavish lifestyle under the guise of seeking to pursue her further education. 22. The Appellant argued before the trial court that extension of parental responsibility cannot exist in a case such as this one where there has never been any parental responsibility exercised by the party against whom the orders are sought. That in any case, the Respondent is an adult who is engaged in gainful personal undertakings which generate sufficient money from which she can fend for herself and cater for her further education. 23. In granting the orders of extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant, the trial court noted that despite the Appellant s claim that he was straining financially to maintain his five (5) children and could therefore not cater for the Respondent s college fees, the strain was attributable to the loans taken out by the Appellant. The trial court went ahead to state it is common knowledge that loans are usually taken for investment. I can therefore safely assume that the defendant has an alternative source of income which he did not disclose. Further that the fact that the loan repayment would end on 5th September, 2019 meant that the Appellant would still be employed until then or that he has an alternative way to service the loans. There was however no evidence of the Appellant s investment portfolio or alternative sources of income. 24. The trial court further noted that all children are equal before the law and that children born in wedlock are no more equal than children born outside wedlock. That if the Appellant can struggle to pay parallel university fees for his daughter, he should also struggle to ensure the Respondent gets basic tertiary education. The court went ahead to hold that special circumstances exist to extend parental responsibility and ordered the Appellant to cater for the cost of the Respondent s diploma course. 25. Indeed, all children are equal regardless of whether they are born in or out of wedlock. The main question for determination however is whether in this instance, the Respondent has demonstrated special circumstances to warrant the issuance of the orders that were granted in the lower court. 26. From the record, I find that there is no legal basis for which the trial court granted the orders for extension of parental responsibility against the Appellant. The Respondent did not demonstrate that she excelled in her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education, or explain why she failed to transition into tertiary education immediately after completing her secondary education. 27. In my view sections 28 and 91(b)(i) of the Children Act envisage a situation where a child attains the age of eighteen (18) years, and the programme in which the child had enrolled for has not lapsed. Such child can successfully apply to the court to compel their parent to see them through the completion of that programme. At the completion of that programme, parental responsibility ceases and the child becomes an adult who ought to fend for himself or herself. (See Allan Njau Waiyaki vs. Eddie http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR Waiyaki Hinga Civil Appeal 34 of 2017 [2019] eKLR ). 28. Whereas in the instant case the Respondent is yet to undertake tertiary education, she waited three (3) years post her secondary school education to pursue her tertiary education and seek the court to extend parental responsibility against her father, the Appellant herein. It is trite that equity does not aid the indolent, and the Respondent herein has clearly slept on her rights. While the Appellant has never contributed towards the Respondent s education all through her life, he is not entirely to blame for his acts or omissions. 29. The evidence on record demonstrates that it was not the Appellant s doing to be out of the Respondent s life. In her examination in chief as shown on the record, the Respondent told the court that she met the Appellant in 2015 after she had completed her secondary school education. That she had never asked her mother about her father out of fear. During cross- examination, the Respondent reiterated that while she knew of the existence of her father, she only met him in 2015. She went on to state: He was surprised to see me because he had not seen me for 19 years. HE recognized me because I resemble my mum. I looked for my father because I had finished form 4 and I was now waiting to join college. My mum was struggling. I did KCSE in 2013. I didn t dictate when I was supposed to meet him. 30. From the Respondent s testimony before the trial court as shown on the record, by the year 2015 she was already two (2) years post-secondary school education having completed her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in the year 2013. As such, at the time of instituting the suit on 24th May, 2017 four (4) years had lapsed since the Respondent completed her secondary school education. It therefore appears that the Respondent s suit seeking extension of parental responsibility is an afterthought fueled by the Respondent s interaction with the Appellant s daughter on the Facebook social media platform. The Respondent in her cross- examination told the trial court My step sister contacted me. I befriended her on Facebook I want the Defendant to pay Kshs. 132,000 - per semester i.e. Kshs. 396,000 - per year. The Defendant s children are in public universities. 31. I note further that at the time when the trial court granted the orders in favor of the Respondent, her letter of admission to [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies was no longer valid and could therefore not sustain the orders. The relevant part of the Respondent s testimony during cross-examination before the trial court is as follows: My admission to [Particulars withheld] has lapsed. I can pursue studies at MKU. I have an admission letter. I don t talk about fees with my step sister. Court: Is your admission to M still available\" Plaintiff: No. I wouldn t feel comfortable going back. I deferred my studies in 2015 July. Court: If you go back will they take you\" Plaintiff: Yes it was a diploma. Court: What did you get in KCSE\" Plaintiff: A C plain. 32. From the record, it is evident that the Respondent is not certain of what course she wants to pursue and where to pursue it. She alluded to having been at M University previously but did not tender any evidence in support thereof. She admitted that her admission to the [Particulars withheld] Institute of Certified Studies had lapsed but stated that she could pursue her studies at MKU. She did not however present an admission letter to MKU or the fee structure of the course she intended to pursue. It appears that all the Respondent has been doing is hop from course to course and from college to college, and has no certain course or college in mind for which she would want the Appellant to cater for the cost of the fees. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 7 CM v SWA [2019] eKLR 33. Based on the foregoing, it is evident that at the time of instituting the suit seeking extension of parental responsibility, the Respondent was not enrolled in any programme for which the Appellant was providing for, or which she was seeking the court to compel the Appellant to cater for. 34. The Appellant no doubt caters for the educational needs of his other children including one who has already attained the age of majority. This does not in any way however compel him to cater for the Respondent s tertiary education. This is because he has always been aware of the existence of his other children and therefore planned for their needs, unlike the Respondent herein. In any event, the Respondent is an adult who can seek employment and cater for her own college fees. Further, in the instant case, the Respondent failed to smoothly transition into tertiary education and is not certain of where she wants to pursue her tertiary education. 35. In the end, I find that the Respondent is not deserving of the orders extending parental responsibility against the Appellant. The result is that the appeal is found to be meritorious and is consequently allowed. The judgment and order of the Children Court at Nairobi made on 21st February, 2018 is hereby set aside forthwith. Based on the nature of this appeal, each party shall bear their own costs. It is so ordered. SIGNED DATED AND DELIVERED IN OPEN COURT THIS 7TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2019. . L. A. ACHODE HIGH COURT JUDGE In the presence of ...Advocate for the Appellant.

Onsarigo (RM)\ndelivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010)\nJUDGEMENT\nINTRODUCTION\n1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the\nlower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st\nrespondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant’s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant’s driver\nor agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was\na passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense\ndenying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the\ndefendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time\nof the accident.\n2. Before considering the facts and the parties’ submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re-\nevaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and\ngiving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see  Selle v Associated\nMotor Boat Co.  [1968] EA 123 ).\n3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that\nwhen they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken\nto the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified\nthat he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/7\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the\nright shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur.\n5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui   Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but\nwas disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000/-. He produced the appellant’s filed list of documents in support of his\ntestimony.\n6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100% liable for the accident, awarded the 1st\nrespondent Kshs 800,000/- as general damages and Kshs 63,860/- as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court\nheld as follows;\n“The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle\nKTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November\n2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the\nowner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor\nvehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable\nway to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100%liable.”\n7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds:\n1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which\nshowed that;\na) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.\nb) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party.\nc) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it.\nd) The appellant was not in possession and/or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.\n2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle\nregistration number KTM 853 was the third party.\n4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant’s documents produced in evidence.\n5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant’s submissions dated\nand filed on 11th September 2015.\n6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities.\n7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive.\nSUBMISSIONS\n8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st\nrespondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/7\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nevidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior\nto the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli\n[2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the\nappellant’s case.\n9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the\nappellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out\nthat the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle.\nHe had also conveniently failed to testify.\n10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between\nthe appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the\nappellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both\nthe appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified.\n11. The appellant also challenged the trial court’s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000/= awarded as\ngeneral damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted\nthat a sum of Kshs. 500,000/= would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered.\n12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third\nparty and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at\nthe material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not\nmove from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant’s\nstature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated\nway of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take\nadvantage of its own mistake.\n13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of\ngeneral damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a\ncompounded fracture which was a very severe.\n14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in\nThika, Kiambu and Murang’a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the\nissues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal.\nANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION\n15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent’s contention that this court lacked\nterritorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent’s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have\njurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang’a. Order 47 Rule 10  of\nthe Civil ProcedureRules  provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in\nthe District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\"\n16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice,\nthe Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the\nHigh Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court.\nBut the converse is true.\n17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice.\nThe High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law.\nThat jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law.\n18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act,\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/7\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nthere are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and\nOthers, 1958 EA 375  which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil\nAppeal No. 287 of 2002)\n19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR,  had this\nto say on the matter;\n           “………… that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country\nsuch as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that\nsuits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and\ndetermination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is\nintended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite\nhearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which\nemphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits.”\n20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be\noveremphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a\ndistrict registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against\nunnecessary costs and inconvenience.\n21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire\nproceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to\ntransfer this appeal to the desired registry.\n22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court\nhad jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the\njurisdiction is dismissed.\n23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains\nto ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of\nKenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of  Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of\n2001 where Warsame J held as follows;\n“Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to\nthe defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show\nthat a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a\npublic document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the\nstandard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the\naccident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the\ndocumentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial\ncontained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact\ndenied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence.”\n24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was\nthe owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in\naccordance with Section 109  of the Evidence Act  which provides that, “ the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the\nperson who wishes the court to believe in its existence...”\n25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time\nthe accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995\nauthorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000/=. DW1 also\nproduced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000/= as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the\nmotor vehicle to her.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/7\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\n26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra),  Ignatius Makau Mutisya\nv Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service & Another (supra) the copy of records\nobtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is\nindicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual\npossession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit.\n27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding\nthat the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent’s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the\nmaterial time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged.\n28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated\nthat the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he\nstated during close examination;\n “….. after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege”\n29. The 1st Respondent’s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search\ncertificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to\ndemonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The\nappellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the\nmotor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st\nRespondent’s case against the appellant.\n30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding\non liability.\n31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the\nevidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time.   This position is informed by the\nfact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle.\n32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd\nRespondent in the trial.   When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated;\n“I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party’s case.”\n33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no\nneed to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor\nvehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent’s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By\nletting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the\neffect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle.\n34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR\nwhere the Court of Appeal held;\n“We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles\nshowing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its\ncontents cannot be later denied. ” [Emphasis added]\n35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana& 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 & 156 of 2012\n[2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows;\n“14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/7\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nthen the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper\nadvertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the\nadvertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what\nthey purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of\nthe motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the\naccident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed\nas much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party\ninsurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take\nout insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that\ndefendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate\nconsidered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had\ndischarged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell\nthe plaintiffs.”\n36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown\nto have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as\nwell as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be\ndealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff’s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to\ntestify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant’s invitation to draw an\nadverse inference from his failure to do so.\n37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed\nthat the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error\nwhen making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would\nhave reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the\naccident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident.\n38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial\ncourt on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in\nsome material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ).\n39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the\nright femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs.\n800,000/= would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by\nthe parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent’s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had\nbeen assessed at 20%. I find no reason to interfere with the trial court’s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs.\n800,000/= made for general damages.\n40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710/= which was the sum pleaded and proved.\n41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows;\na. The trial court’s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100% against the 2nd respondent;\nb. The trial court’s award of general damages is upheld;\nc. The trial court’s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710/=\nd. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.\nDated, Signed and delivered at Kisii this 4th  day of  May, 2020.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/7\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nKenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua & another [2020] eKLR\nA.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon. Often times, the certificate of records may show that one is the registered owner of a vehicle while its actual possession has passed to a third party. The unchallenged evidence of DW1 showed that this was the case in the instant suit. 27. Although the copy of records produced by the 1st respondent showed that the appellant was the registered owner, it is my finding that the evidence of DW1 adequately disproved the 1st respondent s assertion that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle at the material time since his testimony that the appellant had sold the vehicle was not challenged. 28. This is so because on cross examination the 1st Respondent admitted that the police abstract in respect of the accident indicated that the owner of the subject motor vehicle was William Macharia Chege, the 2nd Respondent . At page 7 of the proceedings, he stated during close examination; .. after 3 days I did another search and I noted that the vehicle belonged to William Macharia Chege 29. The 1st Respondent s counsel was, in cross examination of DW1, content with a confirmation that DW1 had no search certificate to indicate that the motor vehicle belonged to Mrs. Waiganjo. Yet DW1 had produced compelling evidence to demonstrate that the motor vehicle had left the hands of the appellant and ownership assumed by one Mrs. Waiganjo in 1995. The appellant had by this demonstration discharged its burden of proof and the plaintiff had the onus to prove the ownership of the motor vehicle as at the time of the accident, a task that was glossed over casually obviously with disastrous effect to the 1st Respondent s case against the appellant. 30. Had the trial magistrate addressed his mind to this evidence, he would have more probably than not, arrived at a different finding on liability. 31. In as much as the appellant failed to lead evidence to show that the vehicle had subsequently been sold to the third party, the evidence on record proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the material time. This position is informed by the fact that the police abstract produced by the 1st respondent identified the third party as the owner of the vehicle. 32. An important aspect of the evidence that in my view was overlooked by the trial court was the position taken by the 2nd Respondent in the trial. When it was the turn of the 2nd Respondent to testify, counsel for the 2nd Respondent stated; I will not call any witness. I wish to close the 3rd party s case. 33. Thus despite the police abstract clearly indicating that the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Respondent, the 2ND Respondent found no need to explain away why the police abstract, a public official document, would have his name as the owner of the subject motor vehicle if that was not the factual position. The 2nd Respondent s filed defence therefore, remained what it is, mere allegations. By letting this opportunity slip through his fingers, the 2nd Respondent unwittingly gave credence to the evidence of the appellant to the effect that as at the time of the accident, the appellant was not the owner of the subject motor vehicle. 34. I find useful guidance in the case of Joel Muga Opinja v East Africa Sea Food Ltd Civil Appeal No. 309 of 2010 [2013] eKLR where the Court of Appeal held; We agree that the best way to prove ownership would be to produce to the court a document from the Registrar of Motor vehicles showing who the registered owner is, but when the abstract is not challenged and is produced in court without any objection, its contents cannot be later denied. [Emphasis added] 35. In the case of Agro-Chemical Food Company Limited v Joel Angana 2 others Civil Appeal No. 154, 155 156 of 2012 [2016] eKLR which falls on all fours with the present case, Majanja J. held as follows; 14. As the plaintiffs established prima facie evidence that the defendant was the registered owner of the motor vehicle and it was http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR then the duty of the defendant to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. DW1 produced copies of newspaper advertisements showing that the motor vehicle was advertised for sale through tender on 26th April 1996. The copies of the advertisements produced were certified copies produced without objection and there is no reason to believe that they were not what they purported to be as they appeared regular on the face. Although the defendant failed to produce a sale agreement of transfer of the motor vehicle in favor of Tridev, there is additional evidence to show that the vehicle had indeed transferred on the date of the accident. PW 4 confirmed that the insurance sticker showed that the vehicle was owned by Tridev and the police abstract confirmed as much. I am aware and take judicial notice of the fact that it is mandatory for every motor vehicle owner to take out third party insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Third Party Risks Act (Chapter 405 of the Laws of Kenya). Why would Tridev take out insurance if it was not the owner of the motor vehicle\" This evidence just goes to show that it is more probable than not that defendant had sold the vehicle to Tridev and it was therefore not the owner on the date of the accident. Had the learned magistrate considered this evidence, he would probably have come to a different conclusion. I therefore find and hold that the defendant had discharged its burden of proving that it was not the owner of the motor vehicle hence the it could not be held liable for what befell the plaintiffs. 36. The third party, who is the 2nd respondent in this appeal, was similarlyidentified as the owner of the vehicle and was also shown to have taken out an insurance cover for the vehicle. The records show that the third party entered appearance and filed a defense as well as a witness statement before the trial court. The court gave directions that all issues arising from the Third Party Notice be dealt with at the hearing of the plaintiff s claim. The Third Party was ably represented during the course of the trial but chose not to testify or call evidence to rebut the claim that he was the owner of the vehicle.I therefore accept the appellant s invitation to draw an adverse inference from his failure to do so. 37. It is also noteworthy that the 1st respondent admitted during cross examination that he had done another search which showed that the vehicle belonged to the third party. It is obvious that based on the evidence on record, the trial magistrate fell into error when making a determination on liability between the three parties.Had the trial magistrate properly considered all facts he would have reached the conclusion, as I have, that the evidence proved that the third party was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident.Consequently, he was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver of the vehicle who caused the accident. 38. As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.

Onsarigo (RM) delivered on 27th January 2016 in Thika CMCC No. 1219 of 2010) JUDGEMENT INTRODUCTION 1. This is an appeal against the judgment of Hon. Onsarigo R.M dated 27th January 2016. The 1st respondent instituted a claim in the lower court against the appellant seeking general and special damages for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. The 1st respondent claimed that on 25th November 2007 the appellant s motor vehicle KMT 853 was being driven by the appellant s driver or agent so negligently al ong Nairobi-Thika road near Theta club that it lost control and rolled several times. The 1st respondent was a passenger in the vehicle and he claims that as a result of the accident he sustained serious injuries. The appellant filed itsdefense denying the claim and also averred that it was not the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 as at 25th November 2007. In due course the defendant issued a third party notice to the 2nd Respondent claiming that the 2nd respondent was the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. Before considering the facts and the parties submissions I must first recognize that the duty of the first appellate court is to re- evaluate and re-assess the evidence adduced before the trial court keeping in mind that the trial court saw and heard the parties and giving allowance for that and to reach an independent conclusion as to whether to uphold the judgment (see Selle v Associated Motor Boat Co. [1968] EA 123 ). 3. Patrick NjaneMbugua (Pw1) recalled that on the material day he was a passenger in motor vehicle KTM 853. He testified that when they got to Kenyatta road the driver was driving at an abnormal speed and lost control. He became unconscious and was taken to the Hospital by good Samaritans. He was later referred to Thika Level 5 Hospital and thereafter to a private hospital. He testified that he suffered a fracture on his right leg and arm and also had a dislocated arm. He reported the incident to Ruiru police station http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 4. Dr. Cyprus Oketch Okere (Pw2) testified that the 1st respondent sustained bruises on the nose, blunt back injury, dislocation of the right shoulder and comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur. 5. The appellant called Jerald Kihui Karanja(DW1) as its witness. DW1 told court that the vehicle was owned by Kenya Power but was disposed in 1995 to Mrs. Waiganjo at Kshs 75,000 -. He produced the appellant s filed list of documents in support of his testimony. 6. After conducting an elaborate hearing, the trial magistrate found the appellant 100 liable for the accident, awarded the 1st respondent Kshs 800,000 - as general damages and Kshs 63,860 - as special damages. In arriving at its determination the trial court held as follows; The plaintiff in his examination in chief did produce a copy of records indicating that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle KTM 853 was owned by the Defendant. The defendant on the other hand called one witness who testified that as at 25th November 2007 the motor vehicle had been sold to Mrs. Waiganjo. However, no evidence was led to indicate that the third party was the owner of motor vehicle KMT 853 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff did produce a copy of records indicating that the motor vehicle at the time of the accident (sic). I therefore hold that the plaintiff discharged his burden of proof as this was the acceptable way to confirm motor vehicle ownership. I hold that the defendant is vicariously liable and hold 100 liable. 7. Dissatisfied with the holding of the trial court, the appellant has filed this instant appeal on the following grounds: 1. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the evidence before him which showed that; a) The appellant was not the beneficial owner of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853. b) That the appellant had sold the said motor vehicle to its employee who later sold it to the third party. c) The appellant had rebutted the presumption of ownership against it. d) The appellant was not in possession and or control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. 2. The learned magistrate failed to consider the evidence of the first respondent which confirmed that the owner of the motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 3. The trial magistrate erred in law in holding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the action of the driver of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853 was the third party. 4. The trial magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to consider the appellant s documents produced in evidence. 5. The learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in failing to properly consider and evaluate the appellant s submissions dated and filed on 11th September 2015. 6. The learned magistrate erred in fact in failing to find that the appellant had proved its defense on a balance of probabilities. 7. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the award of damages in the any event was manifestly excessive. SUBMISSIONS 8. The appeal was dispensed by way of written submissions.Counsel for the appellant, argued in his written submissions that the 1st respondent had failed to discharge his burden of proof regarding the ownership of the vehicle. He submitted that the documentary http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR evidence tendered by the appellant had established that it was not the owner of the ill-fated vehicle as it had been sold 15 years prior to the accident. The cases of Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi [2010] eKLR, Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli [2015] eKLR and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another [2018] eKLR were cited in support of the appellant s case. 9. Counsel argued that if the trial magistrate had carefully evaluated the evidence he would have reached the conclusion that the appellant was not the beneficial owner of the vehicle and that it was the third party who was liable for the accident. He pointed out that the third party had not alluded to the relationship of the appellant and the driver and had not denied ownership of the vehicle. He had also conveniently failed to testify. 10. Counsel also argued that the 1st respondent had failed to establish the existence of a contractual or agency relationship between the appellant and the driver of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident; therefore, the trial court had erred in finding that the appellant was vicariously liable for the actions of the driver. Counsel observed that the identity of the driver was unknown to both the appellant and the 1st respondent. He surmised that the third party would have identified the driver if he had testified. 11. The appellant also challenged the trial court s award of damages. Counsel argued that the sum of Kshs. 800,000 awarded as general damages was excessive as the only serious injury the 1st respondent had suffered was a fracture of the femur. He submitted that a sum of Kshs. 500,000 would have been sufficient compensation for the injuries suffered. 12. Counsel for the 1st respondent countered that the appellant had squandered its opportunity to scrutinize and interrogate the third party and adduce viable evidence to prove that although it was the registered owner, it was the third party who was in possession at the material time. Counsel argued that if the appellant had proved that the third party was in possession, liability would still not move from the registered owner, but it became a shared one with that of the beneficial owner. He contended that the appellant s stature was not the kind that would sell a vehicle to a third party without an agreement. That the appellant also had a sophisticated way of disposing off its property and that if there was a mistake on the side of the appellant, it could not be allowed to take advantage of its own mistake. 13. On the award of damages, counsel argued that the award of special damages had not been challenged and that the award of general damages was in fact lower than the awards made in the authorities adduced since the 1st respondent had suffered a compounded fracture which was a very severe. 14. Counsel also questioned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the matter given that there had been established High Courts in Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. He also declined to respond to the issues of negligence and vicarious liability on the ground that the issues had not been raised in the memorandum of appeal. ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION 15. Before I determine the substantive issues herein, I will first deal with the 1st respondent s contention that this court lacked territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The 1st respondent s counsel urged this court to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter since there had been established a High Court at Thika, Kiambu and Murang a. Order 47 Rule 10 of the Civil ProcedureRules provides that an appeal from a decree or order of a subordinate court to the High Court may be filed in the District Registry within the area of which such subordinate court is situated. But then what is the jurisdiction of the High Court\" 16. The jurisdiction of the High Court is clearly spelt out under Article 165(3) of the Constitution. Through administrative practice, the Chie Justice from time to time by notice in the official Kenya Gazette may amend the schedule listing district registries of the High Court indicating where particular matters may be filed. This may appear to limit the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. But the converse is true. 17. The jurisdiction of a court is a donation of the law and cannot be conferred by the parties or through an administrative notice. The High Court in particular derives its jurisdiction, first and foremost, from the constitution and then from any other written law. That jurisdiction may only be limited or ousted altogether by the law. 18. Unlike the subordinate courts whose territorial jurisdiction is defined by sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Civil Procedures Act, http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR there are no similar substantive provisions in respect of the High Court(See Riddles burger and Another vs Robinson and Others, 1958 EA 375 which was cited with approval in Francis Ndichu Gathongo vs Evans Kitazi Ondansa and Another, Civil Appeal No. 287 of 2002) 19. The Court of Appeal in Sally Njambi Mahihu and Another Vs Mwanguza Kai Deche and Another, [2017] eKLR, had this to say on the matter; that the High Court of Kenya remains one and the same court only that it seats at different locations in the country such as Malindi and Nairobi. The location where it seats cannot therefore affect its jurisdiction. The practice and requirement that suits be found in particular stations of the High Court are purely for administration and convenience in the hearing and determination of suits. That is not in any way to suggest that such requirements or practice is unreasonable or unnecessary; it is intended to reduce costs of transporting witnesses from one corner of the country to another for hearing of cases and to expedite hearing and determination of suits, thus giving meaning to the overriding objective and constitutional value in Article 159 which emphasizes the need to reduce costs and delay in the hearing and determination of suits. 20. The need to have orderly proceedings in the High Court both in the exercise of its original or appellate jurisdiction cannot be overemphasized. There is a discernable requirement to prevent abuse of the court process by forum shoppers who would hop from a district registry to the next for reasons other than seeking fair audience before the courts. Parties must be cushioned against unnecessary costs and inconvenience. 21. An issue on jurisdiction ought to be raised at the earliest stage of the proceedings as it is central to the propriety of the entire proceedings. In our instance suit, had this issue been raised at a preliminary point, the court would have had the opportunity to transfer this appeal to the desired registry. 22. As observed above the jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited. The Appeal has now been heard to conclusion. This court had jurisdiction. There is absolutely no demonstration of any prejudice on the part of the 1st Respondent. The objection based on the jurisdiction is dismissed. 23. Having considered this appeal and the rival submissions by the parties, I found that the main issue raised in the appeal pertains to ownership of motor vehicle registration number KTM 853.In the case of Kabir Mohamed Farouk v Postal Corporation of Kenya [2018] eKLR the court cited the case of Jotham Mugalo Vs. Telkom (K) Ltd Kisumu HCCC No. 166 Of 2001 where Warsame J held as follows; Whereas it is true that it is the responsibility of the plaintiff to prove that the motor vehicle which caused the accident belonged to the defendant and the production of a certificate of search is a valid way of showing the ownership, it is not the only way to show that a particular individual is the owner of the motor vehicle as this can be proved by a police abstract. Since a police abstract is a public document, it is incumbent upon the person disputing its contents to produce such evidence since in a civil dispute the standard of proof requires only balance of probabilities. Where the defendant alleges that the motor vehicle which caused the accident did not belong to him, it is up to them to substantiate that serious allegation by bringing evidence contradicting the documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff as required by section 106 and 107 of the Evidence Act. The particulars of denial contained in the defense cannot be a basis to reject a claim simply because a party has denied the existence of a fact as a fact denied becomes disputed and the dispute can only be resolved on the quality or availability of evidence. 24. At the hearing of the matter before the trial court, the 1st respondent produced a copy of records indicating that the appellant was the owner of the vehicle. Since the appellant was disputing ownership of the vehicle, the burden of proof shifted to the appellant in accordance with Section 109 of the Evidence Act which provides that, the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence... 25. To discharge that burden, the appellant called DW1 who testified that the vehicle had been sold off by the appellant by the time the accident occurred. The witness produced a copy of an internal memorandum of the appellant dated 11th January 1995 authorizing the release of the subject vehicle to one Mrs. Waiganjo who had purchased the vehicle for Kshs. 75,000 . DW1 also produced a copy of a receipt issued to the said Mrs. Waiganjo for Kshs. 75,000 as well as a copy of transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle to her. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 7 Kenya Power And Lighting Company Limited v Patrick Njane Mbugua another [2020] eKLR 26. As held in the cases of Kabir Mohamed Farouk (supra), Nancy Ayemba Ngaira vs Abdi Ali (supra), Ignatius Makau Mutisya v Rueben Musyoki Muli (supra) and Kyoga Hauliers Limited v Malindi Parcels Service Another (supra) the copy of records obtained from the registrar of motor vehicle is not conclusive proof that the sole owner of a vehicle is the person whose name is indicated thereon.

As for the award of damages, I am guided by the principle that an appellate court will only interfere with the findings of a trial court on an award of damages if it can be shown that the court proceeded on wrong principles, or misapprehended the evidence in some material respect, and so arrived at a figure which was either inordinately high or low (see Butt v Khan [1981] KLR 349 ). 39. There was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder, a comminuted segmental fracture of the right femur and bruises to the nose and a blunt injury on his lower back. In coming to the conclusion that an award of Kshs. 800,000 would be adequate compensation for the 1st respondent, the trial magistrate properly assessed the authorities adduced by the parties. He also took into account the severity of the 1st respondent s injuries and the degree of permanent incapacity which had been assessed at 20 . I find no reason to interfere with the trial court s award of general damages and uphold the award of Kshs. 800,000 made for general damages. 40. For special damages, I will reduce the award to Kshs. 46,710 which was the sum pleaded and proved. 41. In the end, I find that this appeal is merited and allow it as follows; a. The trial court s finding on liability is set aside and substituted with liability at 100 against the 2nd respondent; b. The trial court s award of general damages is upheld; c. The trial court s award of special damages is set aside and substituted with an award of Kshs. 46,710 d. The appellant shall have the costs of the appeal and at the trial court to be borne by the respondents.

S. M. Shitubi, CM) delivered\non 14th September, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 339 of 2017)\nJUDGMENT\n1. These are consolidated appeals. The two appellants were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to\nsection 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code.   Particulars of the offence in count 1 were that on the 7th day of February\n2017 in Kitengela Township   within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County, jointly with others not before court while armed with\noffensive weapons namely, Pistols, robbed CA a motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxx Toyota Premio Silver in Colour valued\nat Kshs. 800,000 and a mobile phone make Techno Canon C9s valued at Kshs 18,000 all valued at Kshs. 818,000 and at the time of\nsuch robbery used actual violence against the said Celine Awuor.\n2. Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within\nIsinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed\nTimothy Abong’o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the\ntime of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong’o.\n3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the\nappellants’ defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance.\n4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated.  Dennis Mutinda\nMatheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30\nof 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely;\n1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its\nburden \n2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge \n3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2)\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/14\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nContradicts section 389 penal code\n4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called\n5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence\n6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse\ninferences against him\n5. Alexander Mutiso Peter,  herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No.\n31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda\nMatheka  and Alexander Mutiso Peter  shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively.\n6.   The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that:\n1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the\nprevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification\n2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give\ndescriptions of the attackers\n3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant’s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a\nconviction\n4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd\nappellant’s photo\n5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution’s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and\nillogical.\n6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution’s evidence was not only insufficient but\nalso fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value.\n7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged\nand thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice.\n7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash\nconvictions and set aside the sentences.\n1st Appellant’s submissions \n8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach\ngiven in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses & Another V Uganda  Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the\nargument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive.\n9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that\nthe trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did\nnot inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his\nco-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/14\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga & 3 Others v Republic  CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an\nacknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its\nefficacy must lie in the court’s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and\ndidactic role.\n11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic  [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been\ngiven an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal\nmisconduct.\n12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s/o Msenga v Republic  CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give\nan accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights.\n13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that\nwhenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the\nidentity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531\n(per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539).\n14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification\ndid not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic  [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification\nshould always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume & Another v\nRepublic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic  [1989 KLR 424.)\n15.  He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a\nweapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic  CRA No.\n99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to\nobserving him with a view to identifying him.\n16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He\nrelied on Akumu v Republic  [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of\nwhich truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a\ndeliberately made up case.\n17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo & 2 Others v Republic  [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first\nreport to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification\nparade could not be said to be fool proof.\n18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond\nreasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence.\n2nd Appellant’s submissions \n19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a\nproper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He\nrelied on Waithaka Chege v Republic  [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be\napproached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume & Another v Republic  [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care\nshould be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor.\n20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo & Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and  Mailanyi v Republic  [1986] KLR 198\nfor the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the\nlocation of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole &\nAnother v Republic [2001] eKLR) .\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/14\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that\nPW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the\nconclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers.\n22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo & 2 Others v Republic  [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a\nfirst report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade\ncannot be said to be full proof.\n23. The 2nd appellant further relied on  Kamau Njoroge v Republic  (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification\nis worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade.   A witness should be asked to give a\ndescription of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade.\n24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he\nargued was not possible.   He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that\nobservation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it\nobserved that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that\nhonest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses.\n25. It is the 2nd appellant’s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers\nwas given and that he was not properly identified.   He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the\nvictim to the weapon and not to the attacker.\n26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to\nhis arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he\nwas arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was\ninsufficient to connect him with the offences.  \nRespondent’s submissions\n27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to\nthis appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the\nappellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and\ncomplainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the\ncomplainants were finally dumped.\n28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in\nconversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through\nspecial features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the\nphone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification\nparades.\n29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the\nappellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification.\n30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants.\nIt was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the\nprosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the\nappeal.\nDetermination\n31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on.   I have also perused the trial court’s record\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/14\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nand the impugned judgment.   This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate\nand reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence.   The court should however bear in mind, that it\ndid not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32).\n32. In Kiilu& Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that:\n“An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive\nexamination and to the appellate Court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting\nevidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if\nthere was some evidence to support the lower Court’s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the\nMagistrate’s findings should be supported.   In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the\nadvantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”\n33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic  [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated:\n“As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are\nentitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court\ncannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it\nshould always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect.”\n34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana  (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that:\n“The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if\nneed be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other.”\n35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went\nto fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to\nKitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong’o (PW2).   They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then\nmade her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle\npointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver’s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the\ndoor.  She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back\nseat. \n36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver’s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed\nthe vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was\nforced to look down when they sat near the interior light.   As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and\ngot the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush.   They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport.  She was made to\nundress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces.   The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2.   The\n1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that.   They then left them and\ndrove away after taking her phone.\n37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was\nin PW2’s pocket.   She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld]  gate where they asked a motor cyclist\nto take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements.\n38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of\nthe robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela\nCounty Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it.\n39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was\nasked to go and identify him.   An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant.   She was again call that\nother suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them.   On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an\nidentification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/14\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police\nwhen reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it\nrecorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm.\n41. PW2 Timothy Abong’o  testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela\nwhere PW1 did some business and then they left for home.   When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by\nsome people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them\nfrom behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the\nback seat and lie between the front and back seat.   He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of\nthe head lights.\n42.  He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When\nthey were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when\nhe saw him properly.   He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light.\n43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down.   He was robbed of a cell phone\nTecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500/= which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi.\nThe phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500/- from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and\nwas also beaten.\n44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces.   They went to where motorcycles were\nand took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. \nThey were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment.   He was given a P3 form which was later filled.   His phone and\nmoney were not recovered.\n45.  On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him.   He went and\nidentified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested.   He went and\nidentified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to\nsee him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant.   Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he\nwas able to see the gun and that he never saw the person’s unique mark or his teeth.   He also stated that he gave the police a\ndescription but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw\nanother fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height.\n46. PW3 Jackson Njogu  a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop\nwhen the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked.   These were Tecno C9 and\nSumsung J12.   After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them.   He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and\nSamsung at Kshs. 2,000.   He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him.   On the first day he had gone with\nthe 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him.\n47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House.   He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo\n(PW4) for Kshs. 7,500.   Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500/- later. Omollo went with the phone. \nSometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because\nthe phone was stolen property.   They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released.\nHe denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used\nto see him there.\n48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo  also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone\nfrom PW3 at Kshs. 7,500/-. He paid Kshs. 7000/= and was to pay the balance later.   He tested the phone using his sim card and later\nbought another line.   On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance\nof Kshs. 500/-.   PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance.\n49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office.   When he went there, he found two CID\nofficers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone.   He took them to PW3’s place and both of them were arrested taken to\nKitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone.   He recorded his statement and released\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7/14\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\non bond to be a witnesses.\n50. PW5 Richard Kibor  a clinical officer attached to Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 22nd May, 2017 he attended\nto PW2 who had a history of assault in a robbery incident.   He had scars on the back of the hand right wrist joint and a scar on the\nright knee which had healed.   The injuries were about 10 weeks old.   The probable weapon used was a blunt object.   He signed the\nP3 form on the same day which he produced as an exhibit.\n51. PW6 Ann Nasieko Leyian  also a clinical officer at Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 10th May, 2017 she\nattended to PW1 who also had a history of assault following a robbery incident. She had injuries on the forehead, bruises on other\nparts of the body. She classified the degree of injury as harm.   The injuries were 3 months old.   She signed the P3 form which was\nproduced as an exhibit. According to the notes her cloths were torn.\n52. PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman  of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an\nidentification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade\nconcerning the 2nd appellant.   He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the\nparade to which he acceded.\n53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the\n2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade.   Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance\nwith the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to\ntouch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by\ntouching him on the shoulder.   He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he\nwished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot.   PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by touching him. The 2nd\nappellant made no comment.   He asked the 2nd appellant if he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and he said that\nhe was and signed the form produced as PEX 10. In cross examination, the witness told the court that he never had a conversation\nwith the witness about identification features.\n54. PW8 No. 236160 IP Edgar Nyala  of DCI Kitengela testified that on 26th February, 2017 he was requested by the investigating\nofficer to conduct an identification parade.   He prepared members of the parade who were of similar physical appearance and\ncomplexion with the 1st appellant. He informed the 1st appellant the purpose of the parade and he agreed to participate in the parade\nand signed by thump printing on the form. He also identified the person who would be present during the parade a friend from\nMukuru Kayaba.\n55. The 1st appellant chose to stand between No. 4 and 5.   After the parade was ready, he called PW1 and informed her that her\nattacker may or may not be in the parade.   She identified the 1st appellant by touching him. He asked 1st appellant if he was satisfied\nwith the conduct of the parade and he said he was.   He again put his thumb print on the form.   He then called PW2 and repeated the\nprocedure as he had done with the PW1. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by also touching him.   The 2nd appellant said that he was\nsatisfied with the way the parade was conducted and signed the form.\n56. PW9 No. 235179 APC Moses Mwendwa  of Land Mawe in South B division Nairobi, testified that on 25th February, 2017 at\nabout 8.30 pm, he was called by members of the public over a person they had arrested at Mukuru Kayaba slum.   They went and re\narrested the 1st appellant from members of the public and took him to Hazina AP camp post; interrogated him and called the DCIO\nKitengela who came and collected the 1st appellant as he had a case pending in that station after a person who had been arrested over\nphone stolen during a robbery mentioned him. In cross examination by the 1st appellant, the witness told the court that the police had\nalerted them that the person should be arrested when seen.\n57. PW10 JOO  brother to PW1 and owner of motor vehicle KBQ xxxB, testified that he had given the vehicle to Pw1 for use to\ntake his children to school. He produced the logbook of the vehicle as an exhibit.   He told the court that in February, 2017 he was\ninformed by Kitengela police that the vehicle had been stolen. He talked to PW1 who confirmed that the vehicle had been taken\nfrom her at gun point.\n58. PW11 Daniel Hamisi  who works with Safaricom at the law enforcement section, testified that on 20th February, 2017 he\ngenerated data on request by DCI Kitengela vide their letter dated 16th February, 2017 of particular phone with IMEI number over a\ncase they were investigating. He generated data showing the number the handset had used between 5th February 2017 and 19th\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8/14\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nFebruary, 2017. He established that only two numbers were used.   5th February, 2017, 0720xxxxxx. PW1 was the registered owner\nID number [….]. She had used the phone between 7th February, 2017 and 10th February, 2017 at 3.51 pm.   There was no\ncommunication on 10th February, 2017.   It was used by number 0725xxxxxx owned Stephen Otieno identity card No. [….] until 19th\nFebruary, 2017 and that from 10th February, 2017 the phone registered to be at Kapiti Crescent South B, Mukuru, Kayaba, Mathare\nNorth Area 4 but was mostly used at Mukuru Kayaba.\n59. He told the court that each phone had a unique IMEI; that he generated the report by computer and produced it as PEX 16.   He\nalso signed a certificate under Section 65(8) as read with Section 106B of the Evidence Act and produced it as PEX 17. He\nproduced the letter from police PEX 15.\n60. PW12 No. 99958 PC Reyatone Mwalo  of DCI Kitengela and the investigating officer, testified that on 8th February, 2017, he\nwas instructed to investigate the case.   He called PW1 and PW2 and recorded their statements. On 25th February, 2017 together with\nCIP Nyala, CP Kitonyi,   Macharia and Chanja, they proceeded to Hazina AP Camp after they were notified that the 1st appellant\nhad been arrested by members of the public and was being held there.   They rearrested him and took him to Kitengela police station.\n61. He also testified that on 10th March, 2017 he left the station in the company of CPL Gitonya, PC Mbogo and PC Chanya and the\n1st appellant to Pipeline Nairobi to look for the 2nd appellant but they did not succeed in arresting him.   They came back and got\ninformation that he had been seen at Kitengela and went to look for him. At about 7 pm they found him in a bar within Kitengela\nand arrested him with the assistance of the 1st appellant who identified him.   They also confirmed his name from his identity card\nand took him to the station. PW1 and PW2 identified the 1st appellant on 26th February, 2017 at an identification parade conducted\nby PW7.\n62. The witness further testified that he conducted a search with NTSA and got a copy of records for the motor vehicle KBQxxxB\nwhich showed that it belonged to PW10. He recovered PW1’s phone which he produced as PEX 7.   PW1 had the receipt for the\nphone, IMEI 352879080015523  and produced the receipt as PEX 8. The phone was recovered from PW4 who led them to PW3. \nThe appellants were then charged with the offence.\n63. In cross examination, the witness admitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers. However, in re-\nexamination, he told the court that the complainants gave descriptions of the attackers in their statements. He also told the court that\nPW3 gave information that led to the identification of the appellants and their eventual arrest.\n64. When put on their defence the 1st appellant gave unsworn testimony while the 2nd appellant gave a sworn testimony.   The 1st\nappellant testified that he used to run a hotel business at Mukuru Kayaba in Nairobi but closed in August, 2016 due to business\ndifferences with PW 3 and his sister.   He moved to a different location and started selling scrap metal. He testified that on 25th\nFebruary, 2017 he closed his business and was going home at 7.30 pm when he met a police officer Moses Mwendwa of Hazina AP\nCamp, an undercover agent who was well known to him.  \n65. The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief’s camp. He asked\nthe 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief’s camp, the officer instructed him\nto sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him\nthat they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They\nhandcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station.\n66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people.   He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he\ndenied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m.   He\nwas beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged.\n67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later\nemployed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers.   He\nwould meet customers in bars for discussion.\n68.   On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi’s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer.\nAccording to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her.   The\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9/14\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nofficer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he\nleft for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a\nfriend, Evans Chege.   The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could\nonly go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone.\n69.   The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd\nappellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other\nofficers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer’s wife.   Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another\nofficer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he\nhad so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000/- which he did not have.   He was later put in the cell and told that he\nwould be charged with robbery with violence.\n70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first\nperson who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including\nthe one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he\nrejected the parade.   He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity.\n71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable\ndoubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal.\n72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this\nappeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as\nthe attackers.\n73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that;\n“If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person\nor persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any\nother personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death”\n74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than\none, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the\ncommission of the offence.\n75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men\nwho were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined\nby more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones\nand money.     They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station\nwhere they reported the robbery incident.\n76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the\ncomplainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had\nbeen assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence.\nI am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law.\n77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The\nappellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the\nattackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed\nwere not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the\nsubsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted.\n78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the\nprosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10/14\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\ncomplainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the\nvehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their\nattackers.\n79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that\nPW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to\nidentify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen\nphone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification\nparades.\n80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court’s record and the impugned\njudgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the\nrole of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants’ defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment;\n“I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the\nvictims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me\ndoubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two\nrobberies.\nThere is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point.” \n81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts.\n82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants’ defence. There is no denial that the offence was\ncommitted in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one\nof the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the\nvehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light\nwas one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area.\n83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them;\nundressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According\nto the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify\nthe appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the\nappellants from the parades.\n84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the\ncomplainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination,\nPW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The\nwitness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported.\n85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato  [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of\nidentification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction.\n86. Similarly, in Kamau  Njoroge v Republic  (supra), the Court of Appeal held that;\n“Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade.   The complainant should also be\nasked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court\nhas held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade.”\n87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in\nJohn Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic  [1989] eKLR, that:\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11/14\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n“The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made\nto see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In\nRepublic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for\nthe first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained\nthat the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial.\nSuch witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of\nsuch a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a\nlarge number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view\npoor.”\n88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of\nreporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the\nOB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted\nthe details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went\nto Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers\nat the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant.\n89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they\nwere positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give\ndescriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade\nbecause he was not the one who conducted the parades.\n90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants’ case where\nboth were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the\ncomplainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants’ testimonies that they gave\ndescriptions of their attackers.\n91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed\nby appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials “AM” to signify that they were\nsatisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those\nrespective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able\nto identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers.  On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first.\n92.  Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the\ncomplainants’ evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not\ngive descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating\nofficer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the\nrobbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant.  \n93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant\nassisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd\nappellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away\nfrom the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no\nevidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was\ntraced and arrested therefore remains unclear.\n94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that\nwas before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was\nnot called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not\nclear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that “the events leading to arrest of the\n2nd appellant is a bit unclear.”  With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of\nunclear and doubtful evidence.\n95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12/14\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nreasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the\nprosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe.\n96. Having considered the 2nd appellant’s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently,\nhis appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter,  is hereby set at liberty\nunless otherwise lawfully held.\n97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of\nidentification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold\nthe phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone\nhad been used on PW4’s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had\nsold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well\nknown to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they\nrecorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant.\n98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his\nidentification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible\nevidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence.\n99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen\nphone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st\nappellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the\ninvestigating officer, denied saying it was not true.\n100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent\npossession. In  Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic  [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held:\n“It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the\npossession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and\nsecondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the\ncomplainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen\nproperties can move from one person to another.”\n101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant’s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3\nwho purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant\nwere known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or “flushing”.  The 1st\nappellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District.\n102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated\nhis trial. I have gone through the trial court’s record and the 2nd appellant’s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to\nthe 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice.\n103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed\nfrom the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that\nthe 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld.\n104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the\nSupreme Court decision in the Muruatetu  case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is\ntherefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid,  is sentenced to twenty (20) years\nimprisonment in each count.\n105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when\nsentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13/14\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n2018.

S. M. Shitubi, CM) delivered on 14th September, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 339 of 2017) JUDGMENT 1. These are consolidated appeals. The two appellants were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code. Particulars of the offence in count 1 were that on the 7th day of February 2017 in Kitengela Township within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County, jointly with others not before court while armed with offensive weapons namely, Pistols, robbed CA a motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxx Toyota Premio Silver in Colour valued at Kshs. 800,000 and a mobile phone make Techno Canon C9s valued at Kshs 18,000 all valued at Kshs. 818,000 and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Celine Awuor. 2. Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed Timothy Abong o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong o. 3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the appellants defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance. 4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated. Dennis Mutinda Matheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30 of 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely; 1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its burden 2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge 3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2) http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR Contradicts section 389 penal code 4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse inferences against him 5. Alexander Mutiso Peter, herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No. 31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda Matheka and Alexander Mutiso Peter shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively. 6. The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that: 1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the prevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification 2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give descriptions of the attackers 3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a conviction 4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd appellant s photo 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and illogical. 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution s evidence was not only insufficient but also fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value. 7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged and thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice. 7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash convictions and set aside the sentences. 1st Appellant s submissions 8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach given in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses Another V Uganda Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the argument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive. 9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that the trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did not inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his co-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga 3 Others v Republic CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an acknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its efficacy must lie in the court s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and didactic role. 11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been given an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal misconduct. 12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s o Msenga v Republic CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give an accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights. 13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that whenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the identity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531 (per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539). 14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification did not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic [1989 KLR 424.) 15. He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a weapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic CRA No. 99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to observing him with a view to identifying him. 16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He relied on Akumu v Republic [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of which truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a deliberately made up case. 17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification parade could not be said to be fool proof. 18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. 2nd Appellant s submissions 19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a proper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care should be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor. 20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and Mailanyi v Republic [1986] KLR 198 for the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the location of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole Another v Republic [2001] eKLR) . http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that PW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the conclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers. 22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade cannot be said to be full proof. 23. The 2nd appellant further relied on Kamau Njoroge v Republic (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification is worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. A witness should be asked to give a description of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade. 24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he argued was not possible. He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that observation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it observed that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that honest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses. 25. It is the 2nd appellant s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers was given and that he was not properly identified. He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the victim to the weapon and not to the attacker. 26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to his arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he was arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was insufficient to connect him with the offences. Respondent s submissions 27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to this appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the appellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and complainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the complainants were finally dumped. 28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in conversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through special features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the phone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification. 30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants. It was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the prosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the appeal. Determination 31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on. I have also perused the trial court s record http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR and the impugned judgment. This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate and reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence. The court should however bear in mind, that it did not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32). 32. In Kiilu Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that: An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the Magistrate s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. 33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated: As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are entitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect. 34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that: The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if need be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. 35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went to fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to Kitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong o (PW2). They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then made her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle pointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the door. She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back seat. 36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed the vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was forced to look down when they sat near the interior light. As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and got the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush. They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport. She was made to undress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces. The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2. The 1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that. They then left them and drove away after taking her phone. 37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was in PW2 s pocket. She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld] gate where they asked a motor cyclist to take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements. 38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of the robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela County Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it. 39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was asked to go and identify him. An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant. She was again call that other suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them. On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an identification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police when reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it recorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm. 41. PW2 Timothy Abong o testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela where PW1 did some business and then they left for home. When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by some people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them from behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the back seat and lie between the front and back seat. He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of the head lights. 42. He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When they were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when he saw him properly. He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light. 43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down. He was robbed of a cell phone Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi. The phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500 - from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and was also beaten. 44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces. They went to where motorcycles were and took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. They were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. He was given a P3 form which was later filled. His phone and money were not recovered. 45. On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him. He went and identified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested. He went and identified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to see him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant. Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he was able to see the gun and that he never saw the person s unique mark or his teeth. He also stated that he gave the police a description but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw another fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height. 46. PW3 Jackson Njogu a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop when the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked. These were Tecno C9 and Sumsung J12. After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them. He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and Samsung at Kshs. 2,000. He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him. On the first day he had gone with the 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him. 47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House. He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo (PW4) for Kshs. 7,500. Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500 - later. Omollo went with the phone. Sometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because the phone was stolen property. They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released. He denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used to see him there. 48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone from PW3 at Kshs. 7,500 -. He paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance later. He tested the phone using his sim card and later bought another line. On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance of Kshs. 500 -. PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance. 49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office. When he went there, he found two CID officers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone. He took them to PW3 s place and both of them were arrested taken to Kitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone. He recorded his statement and released http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR on bond to be a witnesses. 50. PW5 Richard Kibor a clinical officer attached to Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 22nd May, 2017 he attended to PW2 who had a history of assault in a robbery incident. He had scars on the back of the hand right wrist joint and a scar on the right knee which had healed. The injuries were about 10 weeks old. The probable weapon used was a blunt object. He signed the P3 form on the same day which he produced as an exhibit. 51. PW6 Ann Nasieko Leyian also a clinical officer at Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 10th May, 2017 she attended to PW1 who also had a history of assault following a robbery incident. She had injuries on the forehead, bruises on other parts of the body. She classified the degree of injury as harm. The injuries were 3 months old. She signed the P3 form which was produced as an exhibit. According to the notes her cloths were torn. 52. PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an identification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade concerning the 2nd appellant. He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the parade to which he acceded. 53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the 2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade. Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance with the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to touch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by touching him on the shoulder. He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he wished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by touching him. The 2nd appellant made no comment. He asked the 2nd appellant if he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and he said that he was and signed the form produced as PEX 10. In cross examination, the witness told the court that he never had a conversation with the witness about identification features. 54. PW8 No. 236160 IP Edgar Nyala of DCI Kitengela testified that on 26th February, 2017 he was requested by the investigating officer to conduct an identification parade. He prepared members of the parade who were of similar physical appearance and complexion with the 1st appellant. He informed the 1st appellant the purpose of the parade and he agreed to participate in the parade and signed by thump printing on the form. He also identified the person who would be present during the parade a friend from Mukuru Kayaba. 55. The 1st appellant chose to stand between No. 4 and 5. After the parade was ready, he called PW1 and informed her that her attacker may or may not be in the parade. She identified the 1st appellant by touching him. He asked 1st appellant if he was satisfied with the conduct of the parade and he said he was. He again put his thumb print on the form. He then called PW2 and repeated the procedure as he had done with the PW1. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by also touching him. The 2nd appellant said that he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and signed the form. 56. PW9 No. 235179 APC Moses Mwendwa of Land Mawe in South B division Nairobi, testified that on 25th February, 2017 at about 8.30 pm, he was called by members of the public over a person they had arrested at Mukuru Kayaba slum. They went and re arrested the 1st appellant from members of the public and took him to Hazina AP camp post; interrogated him and called the DCIO Kitengela who came and collected the 1st appellant as he had a case pending in that station after a person who had been arrested over phone stolen during a robbery mentioned him. In cross examination by the 1st appellant, the witness told the court that the police had alerted them that the person should be arrested when seen. 57. PW10 JOO brother to PW1 and owner of motor vehicle KBQ xxxB, testified that he had given the vehicle to Pw1 for use to take his children to school. He produced the logbook of the vehicle as an exhibit. He told the court that in February, 2017 he was informed by Kitengela police that the vehicle had been stolen. He talked to PW1 who confirmed that the vehicle had been taken from her at gun point. 58. PW11 Daniel Hamisi who works with Safaricom at the law enforcement section, testified that on 20th February, 2017 he generated data on request by DCI Kitengela vide their letter dated 16th February, 2017 of particular phone with IMEI number over a case they were investigating. He generated data showing the number the handset had used between 5th February 2017 and 19th http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR February, 2017. He established that only two numbers were used. 5th February, 2017, 0720xxxxxx. PW1 was the registered owner ID number [ .]. She had used the phone between 7th February, 2017 and 10th February, 2017 at 3.51 pm. There was no communication on 10th February, 2017. It was used by number 0725xxxxxx owned Stephen Otieno identity card No. [ .] until 19th February, 2017 and that from 10th February, 2017 the phone registered to be at Kapiti Crescent South B, Mukuru, Kayaba, Mathare North Area 4 but was mostly used at Mukuru Kayaba. 59. He told the court that each phone had a unique IMEI; that he generated the report by computer and produced it as PEX 16. He also signed a certificate under Section 65(8) as read with Section 106B of the Evidence Act and produced it as PEX 17. He produced the letter from police PEX 15. 60. PW12 No. 99958 PC Reyatone Mwalo of DCI Kitengela and the investigating officer, testified that on 8th February, 2017, he was instructed to investigate the case. He called PW1 and PW2 and recorded their statements. On 25th February, 2017 together with CIP Nyala, CP Kitonyi, Macharia and Chanja, they proceeded to Hazina AP Camp after they were notified that the 1st appellant had been arrested by members of the public and was being held there. They rearrested him and took him to Kitengela police station. 61. He also testified that on 10th March, 2017 he left the station in the company of CPL Gitonya, PC Mbogo and PC Chanya and the 1st appellant to Pipeline Nairobi to look for the 2nd appellant but they did not succeed in arresting him. They came back and got information that he had been seen at Kitengela and went to look for him. At about 7 pm they found him in a bar within Kitengela and arrested him with the assistance of the 1st appellant who identified him. They also confirmed his name from his identity card and took him to the station. PW1 and PW2 identified the 1st appellant on 26th February, 2017 at an identification parade conducted by PW7. 62. The witness further testified that he conducted a search with NTSA and got a copy of records for the motor vehicle KBQxxxB which showed that it belonged to PW10. He recovered PW1 s phone which he produced as PEX 7. PW1 had the receipt for the phone, IMEI 352879080015523 and produced the receipt as PEX 8. The phone was recovered from PW4 who led them to PW3. The appellants were then charged with the offence. 63. In cross examination, the witness admitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers. However, in re- examination, he told the court that the complainants gave descriptions of the attackers in their statements. He also told the court that PW3 gave information that led to the identification of the appellants and their eventual arrest. 64. When put on their defence the 1st appellant gave unsworn testimony while the 2nd appellant gave a sworn testimony. The 1st appellant testified that he used to run a hotel business at Mukuru Kayaba in Nairobi but closed in August, 2016 due to business differences with PW 3 and his sister. He moved to a different location and started selling scrap metal. He testified that on 25th February, 2017 he closed his business and was going home at 7.30 pm when he met a police officer Moses Mwendwa of Hazina AP Camp, an undercover agent who was well known to him. 65. The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief s camp. He asked the 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief s camp, the officer instructed him to sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him that they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They handcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station. 66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people. He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he denied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m. He was beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged. 67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later employed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers. He would meet customers in bars for discussion. 68. On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer. According to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her. The http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR officer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he left for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a friend, Evans Chege. The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could only go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone. 69. The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd appellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other officers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer s wife. Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another officer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he had so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000 - which he did not have. He was later put in the cell and told that he would be charged with robbery with violence. 70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first person who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including the one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he rejected the parade. He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity. 71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal. 72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this appeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as the attackers. 73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that; If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death 74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than one, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the commission of the offence. 75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men who were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined by more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones and money. They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station where they reported the robbery incident. 76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the complainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had been assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence. I am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law. 77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The appellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed were not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the subsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted. 78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the prosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR complainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their attackers. 79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that PW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to identify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen phone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the role of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment; I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the victims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me doubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two robberies. There is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point. 81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts. 82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants defence. There is no denial that the offence was committed in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one of the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the vehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light was one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area. 83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them; undressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According to the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify the appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the appellants from the parades. 84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination, PW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The witness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported. 85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of identification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction. 86. Similarly, in Kamau Njoroge v Republic (supra), the Court of Appeal held that; Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. The complainant should also be asked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court has held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade. 87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in John Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic [1989] eKLR, that: http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made to see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In Republic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for the first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained that the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial. Such witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of such a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a large number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view poor. 88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the OB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted the details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went to Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers at the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant. 89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they were positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade because he was not the one who conducted the parades. 90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants case where both were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants testimonies that they gave descriptions of their attackers. 91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed by appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials AM to signify that they were satisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those respective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able to identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers. On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first. 92. Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the complainants evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating officer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the robbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant. 93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant assisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd appellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away from the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no evidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was traced and arrested therefore remains unclear. 94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that was before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was not called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not clear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that the events leading to arrest of the 2nd appellant is a bit unclear. With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of unclear and doubtful evidence. 95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR reasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the prosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe. 96. Having considered the 2nd appellant s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently, his appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter, is hereby set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held. 97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of identification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold the phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone had been used on PW4 s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had sold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well known to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they recorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant. 98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his identification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible evidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence. 99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen phone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the investigating officer, denied saying it was not true. 100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent possession. In Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held: It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the possession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and secondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the complainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen properties can move from one person to another. 101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3 who purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant were known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or flushing . The 1st appellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District. 102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated his trial. I have gone through the trial court s record and the 2nd appellant s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to the 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice. 103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed from the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that the 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld. 104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the Supreme Court decision in the Muruatetu case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is therefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid, is sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment in each count. 105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when sentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 2018. The sentences of twenty (20) years for each count shall therefore run concurrently from 25th February 2017. Orders accordingly Dated, signed and delivered at Kajiado this 16th day of October 2020.

Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed Timothy Abong o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong o. 3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the appellants defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance. 4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated. Dennis Mutinda Matheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30 of 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely; 1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its burden 2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge 3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2) http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR Contradicts section 389 penal code 4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse inferences against him 5. Alexander Mutiso Peter, herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No. 31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda Matheka and Alexander Mutiso Peter shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively. 6. The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that: 1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the prevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification 2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give descriptions of the attackers 3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a conviction 4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd appellant s photo 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and illogical. 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution s evidence was not only insufficient but also fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value. 7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged and thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice. 7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash convictions and set aside the sentences. 1st Appellant s submissions 8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach given in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses Another V Uganda Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the argument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive. 9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that the trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did not inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his co-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga 3 Others v Republic CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an acknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its efficacy must lie in the court s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and didactic role. 11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been given an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal misconduct. 12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s o Msenga v Republic CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give an accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights. 13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that whenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the identity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531 (per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539). 14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification did not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic [1989 KLR 424.) 15. He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a weapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic CRA No. 99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to observing him with a view to identifying him. 16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He relied on Akumu v Republic [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of which truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a deliberately made up case. 17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification parade could not be said to be fool proof. 18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. 2nd Appellant s submissions 19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a proper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care should be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor. 20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and Mailanyi v Republic [1986] KLR 198 for the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the location of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole Another v Republic [2001] eKLR) . http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that PW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the conclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers. 22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade cannot be said to be full proof. 23. The 2nd appellant further relied on Kamau Njoroge v Republic (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification is worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. A witness should be asked to give a description of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade. 24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he argued was not possible. He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that observation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it observed that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that honest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses. 25. It is the 2nd appellant s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers was given and that he was not properly identified. He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the victim to the weapon and not to the attacker. 26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to his arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he was arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was insufficient to connect him with the offences. Respondent s submissions 27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to this appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the appellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and complainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the complainants were finally dumped. 28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in conversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through special features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the phone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification. 30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants. It was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the prosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the appeal. Determination 31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on. I have also perused the trial court s record http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR and the impugned judgment. This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate and reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence. The court should however bear in mind, that it did not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32). 32. In Kiilu Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that: An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the Magistrate s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. 33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated: As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are entitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect. 34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that: The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if need be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. 35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went to fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to Kitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong o (PW2). They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then made her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle pointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the door. She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back seat. 36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed the vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was forced to look down when they sat near the interior light. As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and got the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush. They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport. She was made to undress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces. The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2. The 1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that. They then left them and drove away after taking her phone. 37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was in PW2 s pocket. She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld] gate where they asked a motor cyclist to take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements. 38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of the robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela County Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it. 39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was asked to go and identify him. An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant. She was again call that other suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them. On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an identification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police when reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it recorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm. 41. PW2 Timothy Abong o testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela where PW1 did some business and then they left for home. When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by some people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them from behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the back seat and lie between the front and back seat. He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of the head lights. 42. He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When they were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when he saw him properly. He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light. 43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down. He was robbed of a cell phone Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi. The phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500 - from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and was also beaten. 44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces. They went to where motorcycles were and took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. They were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. He was given a P3 form which was later filled. His phone and money were not recovered. 45. On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him. He went and identified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested. He went and identified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to see him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant. Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he was able to see the gun and that he never saw the person s unique mark or his teeth. He also stated that he gave the police a description but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw another fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height. 46. PW3 Jackson Njogu a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop when the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked. These were Tecno C9 and Sumsung J12. After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them. He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and Samsung at Kshs. 2,000. He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him. On the first day he had gone with the 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him. 47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House. He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo (PW4) for Kshs. 7,500. Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500 - later. Omollo went with the phone. Sometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because the phone was stolen property. They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released. He denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used to see him there. 48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone from PW3 at Kshs. 7,500 -. He paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance later. He tested the phone using his sim card and later bought another line. On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance of Kshs. 500 -. PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance. 49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office. When he went there, he found two CID officers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone. He took them to PW3 s place and both of them were arrested taken to Kitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone.

PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an identification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade concerning the 2nd appellant. He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the parade to which he acceded. 53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the 2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade. Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance with the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to touch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by touching him on the shoulder. He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he wished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot.

The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief s camp. He asked the 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief s camp, the officer instructed him to sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him that they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They handcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station. 66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people. He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he denied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m. He was beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged. 67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later employed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers. He would meet customers in bars for discussion. 68. On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer. According to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her. The http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR officer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he left for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a friend, Evans Chege. The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could only go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone. 69. The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd appellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other officers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer s wife. Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another officer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he had so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000 - which he did not have. He was later put in the cell and told that he would be charged with robbery with violence. 70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first person who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including the one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he rejected the parade. He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity. 71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal. 72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this appeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as the attackers. 73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that; If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death 74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than one, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the commission of the offence. 75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men who were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined by more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones and money. They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station where they reported the robbery incident. 76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the complainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had been assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence. I am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law. 77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The appellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed were not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the subsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted. 78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the prosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR complainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their attackers. 79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that PW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to identify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen phone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the role of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment; I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the victims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me doubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two robberies. There is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point. 81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts. 82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants defence. There is no denial that the offence was committed in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one of the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the vehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light was one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area. 83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them; undressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According to the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify the appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the appellants from the parades. 84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination, PW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The witness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported. 85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of identification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction. 86. Similarly, in Kamau Njoroge v Republic (supra), the Court of Appeal held that; Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. The complainant should also be asked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court has held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade. 87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in John Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic [1989] eKLR, that: http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made to see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In Republic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for the first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained that the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial. Such witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of such a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a large number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view poor. 88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the OB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted the details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went to Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers at the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant. 89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they were positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade because he was not the one who conducted the parades. 90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants case where both were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants testimonies that they gave descriptions of their attackers. 91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed by appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials AM to signify that they were satisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those respective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able to identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers. On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first. 92. Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the complainants evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating officer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the robbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant. 93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant assisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd appellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away from the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no evidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was traced and arrested therefore remains unclear. 94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that was before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was not called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not clear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that the events leading to arrest of the 2nd appellant is a bit unclear. With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of unclear and doubtful evidence. 95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR reasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the prosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe. 96. Having considered the 2nd appellant s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently, his appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter, is hereby set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held. 97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of identification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold the phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone had been used on PW4 s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had sold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well known to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they recorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant. 98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his identification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible evidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence. 99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen phone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the investigating officer, denied saying it was not true. 100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent possession. In Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held: It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the possession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and secondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the complainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen properties can move from one person to another. 101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3 who purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant were known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or flushing . The 1st appellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District. 102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated his trial. I have gone through the trial court s record and the 2nd appellant s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to the 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice. 103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed from the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that the 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld. 104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the Supreme Court decision in the Muruatetu case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is therefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid, is sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment in each count. 105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when sentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 13 14 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 2018. The sentences of twenty (20) years for each count shall therefore run concurrently from 25th February 2017. Orders accordingly Dated, signed and delivered at Kajiado this 16th day of October 2020.

S. M. Shitubi, CM) delivered\non 14th September, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 339 of 2017)\nJUDGMENT\n1. These are consolidated appeals. The two appellants were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to\nsection 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code.   Particulars of the offence in count 1 were that on the 7th day of February\n2017 in Kitengela Township   within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County, jointly with others not before court while armed with\noffensive weapons namely, Pistols, robbed CA a motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxx Toyota Premio Silver in Colour valued\nat Kshs. 800,000 and a mobile phone make Techno Canon C9s valued at Kshs 18,000 all valued at Kshs. 818,000 and at the time of\nsuch robbery used actual violence against the said Celine Awuor.\n2. Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within\nIsinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed\nTimothy Abong’o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the\ntime of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong’o.\n3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the\nappellants’ defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance.\n4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated.  Dennis Mutinda\nMatheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30\nof 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely;\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1/13\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its\nburden \n2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge \n3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2)\nContradicts section 389 penal code\n4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called\n5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence\n6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse\ninferences against him\n5. Alexander Mutiso Peter,  herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No.\n31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda\nMatheka  and Alexander Mutiso Peter  shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively.\n6.   The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that:\n1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the\nprevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification\n2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give\ndescriptions of the attackers\n3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant’s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a\nconviction\n4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd\nappellant’s photo\n5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution’s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and\nillogical.\n6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution’s evidence was not only insufficient but\nalso fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value.\n7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged\nand thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice.\n7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash\nconvictions and set aside the sentences.\n1st Appellant’s submissions \n8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach\ngiven in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses & Another V Uganda  Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the\nargument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2/13\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that\nthe trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did\nnot inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his\nco-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial.\n10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga & 3 Others v Republic  CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an\nacknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its\nefficacy must lie in the court’s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and\ndidactic role.\n11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic  [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been\ngiven an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal\nmisconduct.\n12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s/o Msenga v Republic  CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give\nan accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights.\n13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that\nwhenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the\nidentity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531\n(per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539).\n14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification\ndid not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic  [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification\nshould always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume & Another v\nRepublic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic  [1989 KLR 424.)\n15.  He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a\nweapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic  CRA No.\n99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to\nobserving him with a view to identifying him.\n16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He\nrelied on Akumu v Republic  [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of\nwhich truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a\ndeliberately made up case.\n17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo & 2 Others v Republic  [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first\nreport to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification\nparade could not be said to be fool proof.\n18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond\nreasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence.\n2nd Appellant’s submissions \n19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a\nproper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He\nrelied on Waithaka Chege v Republic  [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be\napproached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume & Another v Republic  [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care\nshould be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3/13\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo & Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and  Mailanyi v Republic  [1986] KLR 198\nfor the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the\nlocation of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole &\nAnother v Republic [2001] eKLR) .\n21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that\nPW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the\nconclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers.\n22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo & 2 Others v Republic  [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a\nfirst report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade\ncannot be said to be full proof.\n23. The 2nd appellant further relied on  Kamau Njoroge v Republic  (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification\nis worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade.   A witness should be asked to give a\ndescription of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade.\n24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he\nargued was not possible.   He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that\nobservation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it\nobserved that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that\nhonest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses.\n25. It is the 2nd appellant’s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers\nwas given and that he was not properly identified.   He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the\nvictim to the weapon and not to the attacker.\n26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to\nhis arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he\nwas arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was\ninsufficient to connect him with the offences.  \nRespondent’s submissions\n27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to\nthis appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the\nappellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and\ncomplainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the\ncomplainants were finally dumped.\n28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in\nconversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through\nspecial features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the\nphone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification\nparades.\n29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the\nappellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification.\n30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants.\nIt was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the\nprosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the\nappeal.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4/13\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nDetermination\n31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on.   I have also perused the trial court’s record\nand the impugned judgment.   This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate\nand reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence.   The court should however bear in mind, that it\ndid not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32).\n32. In Kiilu& Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that:\n“An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive\nexamination and to the appellate Court’s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting\nevidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if\nthere was some evidence to support the lower Court’s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the\nMagistrate’s findings should be supported.   In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the\nadvantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses.”\n33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic  [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated:\n“As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are\nentitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court\ncannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it\nshould always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect.”\n34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana  (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that:\n“The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if\nneed be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other.”\n35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went\nto fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to\nKitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong’o (PW2).   They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then\nmade her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle\npointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver’s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the\ndoor.  She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back\nseat. \n36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver’s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed\nthe vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was\nforced to look down when they sat near the interior light.   As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and\ngot the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush.   They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport.  She was made to\nundress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces.   The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2.   The\n1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that.   They then left them and\ndrove away after taking her phone.\n37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was\nin PW2’s pocket.   She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld]  gate where they asked a motor cyclist\nto take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements.\n38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of\nthe robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela\nCounty Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5/13\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was\nasked to go and identify him.   An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant.   She was again call that\nother suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them.   On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an\nidentification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant.\n40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police\nwhen reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it\nrecorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm.\n41. PW2 Timothy Abong’o  testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela\nwhere PW1 did some business and then they left for home.   When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by\nsome people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them\nfrom behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the\nback seat and lie between the front and back seat.   He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of\nthe head lights.\n42.  He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When\nthey were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when\nhe saw him properly.   He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light.\n43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down.   He was robbed of a cell phone\nTecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500/= which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi.\nThe phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500/- from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and\nwas also beaten.\n44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces.   They went to where motorcycles were\nand took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. \nThey were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment.   He was given a P3 form which was later filled.   His phone and\nmoney were not recovered.\n45.  On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him.   He went and\nidentified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested.   He went and\nidentified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to\nsee him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant.   Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he\nwas able to see the gun and that he never saw the person’s unique mark or his teeth.   He also stated that he gave the police a\ndescription but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw\nanother fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height.\n46. PW3 Jackson Njogu  a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop\nwhen the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked.   These were Tecno C9 and\nSumsung J12.   After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them.   He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and\nSamsung at Kshs. 2,000.   He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him.   On the first day he had gone with\nthe 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him.\n47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House.   He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo\n(PW4) for Kshs. 7,500.   Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500/- later. Omollo went with the phone. \nSometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because\nthe phone was stolen property.   They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released.\nHe denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used\nto see him there.\n48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo  also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone\nfrom PW3 at Kshs. 7,500/-. He paid Kshs. 7000/= and was to pay the balance later.   He tested the phone using his sim card and later\nbought another line.   On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6/13\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nof Kshs. 500/-.   PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance.\n49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office.   When he went there, he found two CID\nofficers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone.   He took them to PW3’s place and both of them were arrested taken to\nKitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone.   He recorded his statement and released\non bond to be a witnesses.\n50. PW5 Richard Kibor  a clinical officer attached to Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 22nd May, 2017 he attended\nto PW2 who had a history of assault in a robbery incident.

PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman  of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an\nidentification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade\nconcerning the 2nd appellant.   He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the\nparade to which he acceded.\n53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the\n2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade.   Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance\nwith the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to\ntouch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by\ntouching him on the shoulder.   He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he\nwished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot.   PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by touching him. The 2nd\nappellant made no comment.   He asked the 2nd appellant if he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and he said that\nhe was and signed the form produced as PEX 10. In cross examination, the witness told the court that he never had a conversation\nwith the witness about identification features.\n54.

After the parade was ready, he called PW1 and informed her that her\nattacker may or may not be in the parade.   She identified the 1st appellant by touching him. He asked 1st appellant if he was satisfied\nwith the conduct of the parade and he said he was.   He again put his thumb print on the form.   He then called PW2 and repeated the\nprocedure as he had done with the PW1. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by also touching him.   The 2nd appellant said that he was\nsatisfied with the way the parade was conducted and signed the form.\n56. PW9 No. 235179 APC Moses Mwendwa  of Land Mawe in South B division Nairobi, testified that on 25th February, 2017 at\nabout 8.30 pm, he was called by members of the public over a person they had arrested at Mukuru Kayaba slum.   They went and re\narrested the 1st appellant from members of the public and took him to Hazina AP camp post; interrogated him and called the DCIO\nKitengela who came and collected the 1st appellant as he had a case pending in that station after a person who had been arrested over\nphone stolen during a robbery mentioned him.

PW11 Daniel Hamisi  who works with Safaricom at the law enforcement section, testified that on 20th February, 2017 he\ngenerated data on request by DCI Kitengela vide their letter dated 16th February, 2017 of particular phone with IMEI number over a\ncase they were investigating. He generated data showing the number the handset had used between 5th February 2017 and 19th\nFebruary, 2017. He established that only two numbers were used.   5th February, 2017, 0720xxxxxx. PW1 was the registered owner\nID number [….]. She had used the phone between 7th February, 2017 and 10th February, 2017 at 3.51 pm.   There was no\ncommunication on 10th February, 2017.   It was used by number 0725xxxxxx owned Stephen Otieno identity card No. [….] until 19th\nFebruary, 2017 and that from 10th February, 2017 the phone registered to be at Kapiti Crescent South B, Mukuru, Kayaba, Mathare\nNorth Area 4 but was mostly used at Mukuru Kayaba.\n59. He told the court that each phone had a unique IMEI; that he generated the report by computer and produced it as PEX 16.   He\nalso signed a certificate under Section 65(8) as read with Section 106B of the Evidence Act and produced it as PEX 17. He\nproduced the letter from police PEX 15.\n60. PW12 No. 99958 PC Reyatone Mwalo  of DCI Kitengela and the investigating officer, testified that on 8th February, 2017, he\nwas instructed to investigate the case.   He called PW1 and PW2 and recorded their statements. On 25th February, 2017 together with\nCIP Nyala, CP Kitonyi,   Macharia and Chanja, they proceeded to Hazina AP Camp after they were notified that the 1st appellant\nhad been arrested by members of the public and was being held there.   They rearrested him and took him to Kitengela police station.\n61. He also testified that on 10th March, 2017 he left the station in the company of CPL Gitonya, PC Mbogo and PC Chanya and the\n1st appellant to Pipeline Nairobi to look for the 2nd appellant but they did not succeed in arresting him.   They came back and got\ninformation that he had been seen at Kitengela and went to look for him. At about 7 pm they found him in a bar within Kitengela\nand arrested him with the assistance of the 1st appellant who identified him.   They also confirmed his name from his identity card\nand took him to the station. PW1 and PW2 identified the 1st appellant on 26th February, 2017 at an identification parade conducted\nby PW7.\n62. The witness further testified that he conducted a search with NTSA and got a copy of records for the motor vehicle KBQxxxB\nwhich showed that it belonged to PW10. He recovered PW1’s phone which he produced as PEX 7.   PW1 had the receipt for the\nphone, IMEI 352879080015523  and produced the receipt as PEX 8. The phone was recovered from PW4 who led them to PW3. \nThe appellants were then charged with the offence.\n63. In cross examination, the witness admitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers. However, in re-\nexamination, he told the court that the complainants gave descriptions of the attackers in their statements. He also told the court that\nPW3 gave information that led to the identification of the appellants and their eventual arrest.\n64. When put on their defence the 1st appellant gave unsworn testimony while the 2nd appellant gave a sworn testimony.   The 1st\nappellant testified that he used to run a hotel business at Mukuru Kayaba in Nairobi but closed in August, 2016 due to business\ndifferences with PW 3 and his sister.   He moved to a different location and started selling scrap metal. He testified that on 25th\nFebruary, 2017 he closed his business and was going home at 7.30 pm when he met a police officer Moses Mwendwa of Hazina AP\nCamp, an undercover agent who was well known to him.  \n65. The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief’s camp. He asked\nthe 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief’s camp, the officer instructed him\nto sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him\nthat they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They\nhandcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station.\n66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people.   He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he\ndenied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m.   He\nwas beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged.\n67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8/13\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nemployed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers.   He\nwould meet customers in bars for discussion.\n68.   On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi’s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer.\nAccording to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her.   The\nofficer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he\nleft for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a\nfriend, Evans Chege.   The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could\nonly go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone.\n69.   The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd\nappellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other\nofficers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer’s wife.   Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another\nofficer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he\nhad so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000/- which he did not have.   He was later put in the cell and told that he\nwould be charged with robbery with violence.\n70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first\nperson who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including\nthe one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he\nrejected the parade.   He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity.\n71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable\ndoubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal.\n72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this\nappeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as\nthe attackers.\n73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that;\n“If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person\nor persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any\nother personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death”\n74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than\none, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the\ncommission of the offence.\n75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men\nwho were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined\nby more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones\nand money.     They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station\nwhere they reported the robbery incident.\n76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the\ncomplainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had\nbeen assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence.\nI am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law.\n77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The\nappellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the\nattackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9/13\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nwere not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the\nsubsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted.\n78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the\nprosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the\ncomplainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the\nvehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their\nattackers.\n79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that\nPW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to\nidentify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen\nphone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification\nparades.\n80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court’s record and the impugned\njudgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the\nrole of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants’ defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment;\n“I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the\nvictims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me\ndoubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two\nrobberies.\nThere is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point.” \n81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts.\n82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants’ defence. There is no denial that the offence was\ncommitted in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one\nof the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the\nvehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light\nwas one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area.\n83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them;\nundressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According\nto the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify\nthe appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the\nappellants from the parades.\n84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the\ncomplainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination,\nPW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The\nwitness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported.\n85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato  [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of\nidentification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction.\n86. Similarly, in Kamau  Njoroge v Republic  (supra), the Court of Appeal held that;\n“Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade.   The complainant should also be\nasked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court\nhas held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade.”\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10/13\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in\nJohn Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic  [1989] eKLR, that:\n“The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made\nto see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In\nRepublic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for\nthe first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained\nthat the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial.\nSuch witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of\nsuch a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a\nlarge number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view\npoor.”\n88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of\nreporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the\nOB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted\nthe details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went\nto Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers\nat the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant.\n89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they\nwere positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give\ndescriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade\nbecause he was not the one who conducted the parades.\n90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants’ case where\nboth were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the\ncomplainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants’ testimonies that they gave\ndescriptions of their attackers.\n91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed\nby appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials “AM” to signify that they were\nsatisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those\nrespective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able\nto identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers.  On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first.\n92.  Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the\ncomplainants’ evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not\ngive descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating\nofficer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the\nrobbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant.  \n93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant\nassisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd\nappellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away\nfrom the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no\nevidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was\ntraced and arrested therefore remains unclear.\n94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that\nwas before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was\nnot called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not\nclear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that “the events leading to arrest of the\n2nd appellant is a bit unclear.”  With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11/13\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\nunclear and doubtful evidence.\n95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond\nreasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the\nprosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe.\n96. Having considered the 2nd appellant’s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently,\nhis appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter,  is hereby set at liberty\nunless otherwise lawfully held.\n97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of\nidentification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold\nthe phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone\nhad been used on PW4’s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had\nsold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well\nknown to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they\nrecorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant.\n98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his\nidentification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible\nevidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence.\n99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen\nphone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st\nappellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the\ninvestigating officer, denied saying it was not true.\n100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent\npossession. In  Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic  [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held:\n“It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the\npossession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and\nsecondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the\ncomplainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen\nproperties can move from one person to another.”\n101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant’s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3\nwho purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant\nwere known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or “flushing”.  The 1st\nappellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District.\n102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated\nhis trial. I have gone through the trial court’s record and the 2nd appellant’s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to\nthe 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice.\n103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed\nfrom the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that\nthe 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld.\n104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the\nSupreme Court decision in the Muruatetu  case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is\ntherefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid,  is sentenced to twenty (20) years\nimprisonment in each count.\nhttp://www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12/13\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nDennis Mutinda Matheka & another v Republic [2020] eKLR\n105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when\nsentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September\n2018. The sentences of twenty (20) years for each count shall therefore run concurrently from 25th February 2017.\nOrders accordingly\nDated, signed and delivered at Kajiado this 16th day of October 2020.\nE.C.

S. M. Shitubi, CM) delivered on 14th September, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 339 of 2017) JUDGMENT 1. These are consolidated appeals. The two appellants were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code. Particulars of the offence in count 1 were that on the 7th day of February 2017 in Kitengela Township within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County, jointly with others not before court while armed with offensive weapons namely, Pistols, robbed CA a motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxx Toyota Premio Silver in Colour valued at Kshs. 800,000 and a mobile phone make Techno Canon C9s valued at Kshs 18,000 all valued at Kshs. 818,000 and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Celine Awuor. 2. Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed Timothy Abong o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong o. 3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the appellants defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance. 4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated. Dennis Mutinda Matheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30 of 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely; http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its burden 2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge 3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2) Contradicts section 389 penal code 4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse inferences against him 5. Alexander Mutiso Peter, herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No. 31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda Matheka and Alexander Mutiso Peter shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively. 6. The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that: 1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the prevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification 2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give descriptions of the attackers 3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a conviction 4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd appellant s photo 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and illogical. 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution s evidence was not only insufficient but also fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value. 7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged and thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice. 7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash convictions and set aside the sentences. 1st Appellant s submissions 8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach given in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses Another V Uganda Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the argument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that the trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did not inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his co-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial. 10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga 3 Others v Republic CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an acknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its efficacy must lie in the court s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and didactic role. 11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been given an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal misconduct. 12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s o Msenga v Republic CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give an accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights. 13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that whenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the identity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531 (per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539). 14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification did not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic [1989 KLR 424.) 15. He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a weapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic CRA No. 99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to observing him with a view to identifying him. 16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He relied on Akumu v Republic [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of which truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a deliberately made up case. 17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification parade could not be said to be fool proof. 18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. 2nd Appellant s submissions 19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a proper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care should be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and Mailanyi v Republic [1986] KLR 198 for the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the location of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole Another v Republic [2001] eKLR) . 21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that PW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the conclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers. 22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade cannot be said to be full proof. 23. The 2nd appellant further relied on Kamau Njoroge v Republic (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification is worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. A witness should be asked to give a description of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade. 24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he argued was not possible. He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that observation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it observed that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that honest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses. 25. It is the 2nd appellant s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers was given and that he was not properly identified. He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the victim to the weapon and not to the attacker. 26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to his arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he was arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was insufficient to connect him with the offences. Respondent s submissions 27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to this appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the appellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and complainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the complainants were finally dumped. 28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in conversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through special features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the phone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification. 30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants. It was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the prosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the appeal. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR Determination 31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate and reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence. The court should however bear in mind, that it did not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32). 32. In Kiilu Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that: An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the Magistrate s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. 33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated: As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are entitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect. 34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that: The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if need be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. 35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went to fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to Kitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong o (PW2). They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then made her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle pointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the door. She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back seat. 36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed the vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was forced to look down when they sat near the interior light. As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and got the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush. They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport. She was made to undress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces. The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2. The 1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that. They then left them and drove away after taking her phone. 37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was in PW2 s pocket. She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld] gate where they asked a motor cyclist to take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements. 38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of the robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela County Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was asked to go and identify him. An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant. She was again call that other suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them. On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an identification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant. 40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police when reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it recorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm. 41. PW2 Timothy Abong o testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela where PW1 did some business and then they left for home. When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by some people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them from behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the back seat and lie between the front and back seat. He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of the head lights. 42. He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When they were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when he saw him properly. He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light. 43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down. He was robbed of a cell phone Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi. The phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500 - from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and was also beaten. 44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces. They went to where motorcycles were and took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. They were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. He was given a P3 form which was later filled. His phone and money were not recovered. 45. On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him. He went and identified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested. He went and identified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to see him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant. Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he was able to see the gun and that he never saw the person s unique mark or his teeth. He also stated that he gave the police a description but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw another fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height. 46. PW3 Jackson Njogu a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop when the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked. These were Tecno C9 and Sumsung J12. After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them. He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and Samsung at Kshs. 2,000. He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him. On the first day he had gone with the 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him. 47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House. He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo (PW4) for Kshs. 7,500. Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500 - later. Omollo went with the phone. Sometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because the phone was stolen property. They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released. He denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used to see him there. 48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone from PW3 at Kshs. 7,500 -. He paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance later. He tested the phone using his sim card and later bought another line. On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR of Kshs. 500 -. PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance. 49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office. When he went there, he found two CID officers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone. He took them to PW3 s place and both of them were arrested taken to Kitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone. He recorded his statement and released on bond to be a witnesses. 50. PW5 Richard Kibor a clinical officer attached to Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 22nd May, 2017 he attended to PW2 who had a history of assault in a robbery incident. He had scars on the back of the hand right wrist joint and a scar on the right knee which had healed. The injuries were about 10 weeks old. The probable weapon used was a blunt object. He signed the P3 form on the same day which he produced as an exhibit. 51. PW6 Ann Nasieko Leyian also a clinical officer at Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 10th May, 2017 she attended to PW1 who also had a history of assault following a robbery incident. She had injuries on the forehead, bruises on other parts of the body. She classified the degree of injury as harm. The injuries were 3 months old. She signed the P3 form which was produced as an exhibit. According to the notes her cloths were torn. 52. PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an identification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade concerning the 2nd appellant. He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the parade to which he acceded. 53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the 2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade. Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance with the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to touch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by touching him on the shoulder. He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he wished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by touching him. The 2nd appellant made no comment. He asked the 2nd appellant if he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and he said that he was and signed the form produced as PEX 10. In cross examination, the witness told the court that he never had a conversation with the witness about identification features. 54. PW8 No. 236160 IP Edgar Nyala of DCI Kitengela testified that on 26th February, 2017 he was requested by the investigating officer to conduct an identification parade. He prepared members of the parade who were of similar physical appearance and complexion with the 1st appellant. He informed the 1st appellant the purpose of the parade and he agreed to participate in the parade and signed by thump printing on the form. He also identified the person who would be present during the parade a friend from Mukuru Kayaba. 55. The 1st appellant chose to stand between No. 4 and 5. After the parade was ready, he called PW1 and informed her that her attacker may or may not be in the parade. She identified the 1st appellant by touching him. He asked 1st appellant if he was satisfied with the conduct of the parade and he said he was. He again put his thumb print on the form. He then called PW2 and repeated the procedure as he had done with the PW1. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by also touching him. The 2nd appellant said that he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and signed the form. 56. PW9 No. 235179 APC Moses Mwendwa of Land Mawe in South B division Nairobi, testified that on 25th February, 2017 at about 8.30 pm, he was called by members of the public over a person they had arrested at Mukuru Kayaba slum. They went and re arrested the 1st appellant from members of the public and took him to Hazina AP camp post; interrogated him and called the DCIO Kitengela who came and collected the 1st appellant as he had a case pending in that station after a person who had been arrested over phone stolen during a robbery mentioned him. In cross examination by the 1st appellant, the witness told the court that the police had alerted them that the person should be arrested when seen. 57. PW10 JOO brother to PW1 and owner of motor vehicle KBQ xxxB, testified that he had given the vehicle to Pw1 for use to take his children to school. He produced the logbook of the vehicle as an exhibit. He told the court that in February, 2017 he was informed by Kitengela police that the vehicle had been stolen. He talked to PW1 who confirmed that the vehicle had been taken http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR from her at gun point. 58. PW11 Daniel Hamisi who works with Safaricom at the law enforcement section, testified that on 20th February, 2017 he generated data on request by DCI Kitengela vide their letter dated 16th February, 2017 of particular phone with IMEI number over a case they were investigating. He generated data showing the number the handset had used between 5th February 2017 and 19th February, 2017. He established that only two numbers were used. 5th February, 2017, 0720xxxxxx. PW1 was the registered owner ID number [ .]. She had used the phone between 7th February, 2017 and 10th February, 2017 at 3.51 pm. There was no communication on 10th February, 2017. It was used by number 0725xxxxxx owned Stephen Otieno identity card No. [ .] until 19th February, 2017 and that from 10th February, 2017 the phone registered to be at Kapiti Crescent South B, Mukuru, Kayaba, Mathare North Area 4 but was mostly used at Mukuru Kayaba. 59. He told the court that each phone had a unique IMEI; that he generated the report by computer and produced it as PEX 16. He also signed a certificate under Section 65(8) as read with Section 106B of the Evidence Act and produced it as PEX 17. He produced the letter from police PEX 15. 60. PW12 No. 99958 PC Reyatone Mwalo of DCI Kitengela and the investigating officer, testified that on 8th February, 2017, he was instructed to investigate the case. He called PW1 and PW2 and recorded their statements. On 25th February, 2017 together with CIP Nyala, CP Kitonyi, Macharia and Chanja, they proceeded to Hazina AP Camp after they were notified that the 1st appellant had been arrested by members of the public and was being held there. They rearrested him and took him to Kitengela police station. 61. He also testified that on 10th March, 2017 he left the station in the company of CPL Gitonya, PC Mbogo and PC Chanya and the 1st appellant to Pipeline Nairobi to look for the 2nd appellant but they did not succeed in arresting him. They came back and got information that he had been seen at Kitengela and went to look for him. At about 7 pm they found him in a bar within Kitengela and arrested him with the assistance of the 1st appellant who identified him. They also confirmed his name from his identity card and took him to the station. PW1 and PW2 identified the 1st appellant on 26th February, 2017 at an identification parade conducted by PW7. 62. The witness further testified that he conducted a search with NTSA and got a copy of records for the motor vehicle KBQxxxB which showed that it belonged to PW10. He recovered PW1 s phone which he produced as PEX 7. PW1 had the receipt for the phone, IMEI 352879080015523 and produced the receipt as PEX 8. The phone was recovered from PW4 who led them to PW3. The appellants were then charged with the offence. 63. In cross examination, the witness admitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers. However, in re- examination, he told the court that the complainants gave descriptions of the attackers in their statements. He also told the court that PW3 gave information that led to the identification of the appellants and their eventual arrest. 64. When put on their defence the 1st appellant gave unsworn testimony while the 2nd appellant gave a sworn testimony. The 1st appellant testified that he used to run a hotel business at Mukuru Kayaba in Nairobi but closed in August, 2016 due to business differences with PW 3 and his sister. He moved to a different location and started selling scrap metal. He testified that on 25th February, 2017 he closed his business and was going home at 7.30 pm when he met a police officer Moses Mwendwa of Hazina AP Camp, an undercover agent who was well known to him. 65. The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief s camp. He asked the 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief s camp, the officer instructed him to sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him that they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They handcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station. 66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people. He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he denied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m. He was beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged. 67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR employed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers. He would meet customers in bars for discussion. 68. On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer. According to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her. The officer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he left for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a friend, Evans Chege. The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could only go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone. 69. The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd appellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other officers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer s wife. Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another officer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he had so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000 - which he did not have. He was later put in the cell and told that he would be charged with robbery with violence. 70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first person who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including the one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he rejected the parade. He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity. 71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal. 72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this appeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as the attackers. 73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that; If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death 74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than one, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the commission of the offence. 75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men who were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined by more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones and money. They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station where they reported the robbery incident. 76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the complainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had been assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence. I am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law. 77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The appellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR were not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the subsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted. 78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the prosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the complainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their attackers. 79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that PW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to identify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen phone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the role of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment; I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the victims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me doubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two robberies. There is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point. 81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts. 82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants defence. There is no denial that the offence was committed in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one of the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the vehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light was one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area. 83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them; undressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According to the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify the appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the appellants from the parades. 84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination, PW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The witness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported. 85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of identification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction. 86. Similarly, in Kamau Njoroge v Republic (supra), the Court of Appeal held that; Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. The complainant should also be asked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court has held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in John Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic [1989] eKLR, that: The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made to see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In Republic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for the first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained that the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial. Such witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of such a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a large number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view poor. 88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the OB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted the details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went to Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers at the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant. 89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they were positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade because he was not the one who conducted the parades. 90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants case where both were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants testimonies that they gave descriptions of their attackers. 91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed by appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials AM to signify that they were satisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those respective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able to identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers. On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first. 92. Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the complainants evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating officer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the robbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant. 93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant assisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd appellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away from the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no evidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was traced and arrested therefore remains unclear. 94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that was before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was not called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not clear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that the events leading to arrest of the 2nd appellant is a bit unclear. With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR unclear and doubtful evidence. 95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the prosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe. 96. Having considered the 2nd appellant s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently, his appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter, is hereby set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held. 97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of identification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold the phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone had been used on PW4 s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had sold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well known to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they recorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant. 98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his identification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible evidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence. 99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen phone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the investigating officer, denied saying it was not true. 100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent possession. In Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held: It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the possession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and secondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the complainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen properties can move from one person to another. 101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3 who purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant were known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or flushing . The 1st appellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District. 102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated his trial. I have gone through the trial court s record and the 2nd appellant s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to the 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice. 103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed from the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that the 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld. 104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the Supreme Court decision in the Muruatetu case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is therefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid, is sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment in each count. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when sentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September 2018. The sentences of twenty (20) years for each count shall therefore run concurrently from 25th February 2017. Orders accordingly Dated, signed and delivered at Kajiado this 16th day of October 2020.

S. M. Shitubi, CM) delivered on 14th September, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 339 of 2017) JUDGMENT 1. These are consolidated appeals. The two appellants were jointly charged with two counts of robbery with violence contrary to section 295 as read with section 296(2) of the Penal Code. Particulars of the offence in count 1 were that on the 7th day of February 2017 in Kitengela Township within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County, jointly with others not before court while armed with offensive weapons namely, Pistols, robbed CA a motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxx Toyota Premio Silver in Colour valued at Kshs. 800,000 and a mobile phone make Techno Canon C9s valued at Kshs 18,000 all valued at Kshs. 818,000 and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Celine Awuor. 2. Particulars of the offence in count 2 stated that on the same day, 7th February, 2017 at 2100hrs in Kitengela Township, within Isinya Sub County of Kajiado County with others not before court, being armed with offensive weapons, namely; Pistol, robbed Timothy Abong o a mobile phone make Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 and cash Kshs. 500, all valued at Kshs. 7,000, and at the time of such robbery used actual violence against the said Timothy Abong o. 3. The appellants pleaded not guilty to the two counts and after a trial in which the prosecution called 12 witnesses and the appellants defence, they were convicted in both counts and sentenced to death in count 1. Count 2 was held in abeyance. 4. They were aggrieved with both conviction and sentence and lodged separate appeals which were consolidated. Dennis Mutinda Matheka alias stupid, herein referred to as the 1st appellant, filed a petition of appeal on 16th July, 2019 in criminal appeal No. 30 of 2019 and raised the following grounds, namely; http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 1 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 1. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him despite the fact that the prosecution did not discharge its burden 2. That the trial magistrate erred in law and fact by convicting him yet the evidence did not support the charge 3. That the learned magistrate erred in law and fact when she imposed a death penalty which was unfounded as section 297(2) Contradicts section 389 penal code 4. That the trial court erred in law and fact in convicting the appellant when crucial witnesses were not called 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact by dismissing his defence 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact by failing to discharge its mandate of evaluating the evidence before drawing adverse inferences against him 5. Alexander Mutiso Peter, herein the 2nd appellant, also filed his memorandum of appeal on the same day in criminal appeal No. 31 of 2019 and raised similar grounds of appeal as those of the 1st appellant. I see no reason to repeat them here. Dennis Mutinda Matheka and Alexander Mutiso Peter shall henceforth be referred to as the 1st and 2nd appellants respectively. 6. The 1st appellant filed together with his submissions further grounds of appeal that: 1. That trial magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to find that the prosecution did not prove to the required standard that the prevailing conditions were conducive for positive identification 2. That the trial court overlooked the first report made by the complainant at the police station which did not identify him or give descriptions of the attackers 3. That the testimonies tendered on the 1st appellant s mode of arrest were riddled with doubts and was not enough to sustain a conviction 4. That the trial court erred in accepting the parade conducted against the said appellant yet the witness had been shown the 2nd appellant s photo 5. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to find that the prosecution s witnesses evidence was unbelievable and illogical. 6. That the trial court erred in law and fact in failing to appreciate that the prosecution s evidence was not only insufficient but also fabricated, speculative, conjecture, discredited, inconsistent in material particular and lacked probative value. 7. That the trial court erred in law by failing to rule that the burden and standard of proof by the prosecution was not discharged and thus the guilty verdict was unsafe and could not be supported having regard the evidence thus led to miscarriage of justice. 7. During the hearing of the appeal, the appellants relied on their written submissions and urged the court to allow the appeal, quash convictions and set aside the sentences. 1st Appellant s submissions 8. In his writes submissions filed on 18th March 2020, the 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution did not follow the approach given in decided cases on identification. He relied on Bogere Moses Another V Uganda Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1997, for the argument that the court ought to satisfy itself that the conditions under which identification took place were conducive. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 2 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 9. He also argued that the mandatory provisions of section 208 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code were not complied with in that the trial court never informed him of his right to cross-examine his co-accused. The 1st appellant contended that the trial court did not inform him of his right to cross-examine the witnesses and since he was not informed that he had the right to cross-examine his co-accused, this failure vitiated the trial given that cross-examination is one of the key ingredients of a fair trial. 10. The 1st appellant relied on Ezekiel Nyaga 3 Others v Republic CRA No. 9 of 1985, for the submission that the provision is an acknowledgement of the disadvantage at which an unrepresented accused stands and is intended to level the playing field and its efficacy must lie in the court s ability to appreciate its fair trial implications and its concomitant duty to play more active and didactic role. 11. He again relied on Godhana v Republic [1991] KLR 471 where the Court of Appeal stated that since the appellant had not been given an opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused and the prosecution witnesses; this vitiated the trial and was a fatal misconduct. 12. The 1st appellant further relied on Edward s o Msenga v Republic CRA No. 123 of 1956 for the submission that failure to give an accused an opportunity to cross-examine a co-accused was no less prejudicial and was indeed a denial of fundamental rights. 13. The 1st appellant submitted that the prevailing conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. He argued that whenever an accused pleads not guilty, everything is in issue and the prosecution has to prove the whole of their case, including the identity of the accused, nature of the act and the extent of any necessary knowledge or intent. He relied on R v Sims [1946] KB 531 (per Lord Goddard CJ, P 539). 14. According to the 1st appellant, the crime having been committed at 7.30pm, conditions for a proper and positive identification did not exist. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1979] KLR 271 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution where conditions were poor. (See also Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1900] KLR 23 and Wamunga v Republic [1989 KLR 424.) 15. He also argued that the complainants must have been in a state of panic to positively identify him since the mere presence of a weapon attracts more attention from the attacker. On this argument, the 1st appellant relied on Augustine Ritho v Republic CRA No. 99 of 1986, contending that the complainants must have been more worried about their security and self-preservation as opposed to observing him with a view to identifying him. 16. The 1st appellant again submitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers at the first opportunity. He relied on Akumu v Republic [1954] EACA 21 for the proposition that evidence of first report after attack proves a good test of which truth and accuracy of subsequent statements may be guide and provides a safeguard against later establishment or a deliberately made up case. 17. He further relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by the complainants giving a description of the appellant, the subsequent identification in an identification parade could not be said to be fool proof. 18. The 1st appellant relied on many other decisions and urged the court to find that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, allow his appeal, quash the conviction and set aside the sentence. 2nd Appellant s submissions 19. In his written submissions, the 2nd appellant also argued that he was not properly identified; that the conditions did not favour a proper identification and that the person who purported to have identified him could not have done so in the circumstances. He relied on Waithaka Chege v Republic [1997] KLR 217 for the submission that evidence of visual identification should always be approached with great care and caution, and Gikonyo Karume Another v Republic [1990] KLR 22 for the submission that care should be exercised where the conditions for a favourable identification are poor. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 3 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 20. He also relied on Abdalla Bin Wendo Another v Republic [1955] 20 EACA166 and Mailanyi v Republic [1986] KLR 198 for the submission that before acting on such evidence, the trial court must make inquiries as to the presence and nature of light, the location of the source of light in relation to the accused so as to be able to identify him subsequently. (See also Paul Etole Another v Republic [2001] eKLR) . 21. According to the 2nd appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 did not show how he was identified and the source of light; that PW12 stated that PW1and PW2 did not give disruptions of the assailants when they recorded their statements and therefore the conclusion to be drawn from such evidence is that PW1 and PW2 could not identify their attackers. 22. The 2nd appellant relied on John Njagi Kadogo 2 Others v Republic [2006] eKLR for the submission that in the absence of a first report to the police by witnesses giving a description of the attackers, the subsequent identification in an identification parade cannot be said to be full proof. 23. The 2nd appellant further relied on Kamau Njoroge v Republic (1982- 88) KLR 1134, for the submission that dock identification is worthless unless this had been preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. A witness should be asked to give a description of the accused and thereafter the prosecution should arrange a fair identification parade. 24. According to the 2nd appellant, when PW1 was cross examined she stated that it took 1 minute to identify someone which he argued was not possible. He relied on the Canadian case of Republic v Hane Maayeu 2008 ONCA 580, for the submission that observation by a witness that she honestly believed that she had identified the right person was rebuked by the court when it observed that what happened in that case was consistent with what is known about mistaken identification evidence in particular that honest but mistaken witnesses make convicting witnesses. 25. It is the 2nd appellant s case that the prosecution did not prove that he was one of the attackers; that no description of attackers was given and that he was not properly identified. He argued that presence of a weapon would ordinarily attract the attention of the victim to the weapon and not to the attacker. 26. This appellant argued that his mode of arrest was unclear and that the trial court had stated in its judgment that events leading to his arrest were unclear. He contended that PW1 and PW2 did not lead to his arrest and even claimed that they did not know how he was arrested. He also argued that no witness claimed to know him except PW3. He therefore contended that the evidence was insufficient to connect him with the offences. Respondent s submissions 27. Mr. Meroka, counsel for the prosecution filed written submissions on 22nd July 2020 on behalf of the respondent in opposition to this appeal. On identification, he submitted that conditions were favourable to enable the complainants positively identify the appellants; that the appellants shone a touch light when forcing the complainants into the vehicle and that the appellants and complainants interacted for some time. It was also argued that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place where the complainants were finally dumped. 28. The prosecution counsel further argued that the appellants were at close range and proximity and engaged the complainants in conversations; stripped PW1 naked as they teased her with rape; that the complainants were able to identify the appellants through special features and body size as short guys and finally, PW3 was able to identify 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the phone that was later recovered. These, he argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 29. It was argued that there were security lights from a nearby gate with sufficient light to enable a positive identification; that the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on thus enabling identification. 30. Next, the prosecution counsel submitted that the appellants used force to take control of motor vehicle and robbed the occupants. It was further submitted that the complainants were clear that one of the attackers was armed with a pistol and, therefore, the prosecution proved the ingredients of the offence thus proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He urged the court to dismiss the appeal. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 4 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR Determination 31. I have considered this appeal submission by both sides and the authorities relied on. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this court as the first appellate court, to reconsider, reevaluate and reanalyze the evidence afresh and come to its own conclusion on that evidence. The court should however bear in mind, that it did not see witnesses testify and give due allowance to that. (See Okeno v Republic [1972] EA 32). 32. In Kiilu Another v Republic [2005]1 KLR 174, the Court of Appeal held that: An Appellant on a first appeal is entitled to expect the evidence as a whole to be submitted to a fresh and exhaustive examination and to the appellate Court s own decision on the evidence. The first appellate Court must itself weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own conclusions. It is not the function of a first appellate Court merely to scrutinize the evidence to see if there was some evidence to support the lower Court s findings and conclusions; only then can it decide whether the Magistrate s findings should be supported. In doing so, it should make allowance for the fact that the trial Court has had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. 33. In Kamau Njoroge v Republic [1987] eKLR, the Court of Appeal also stated: As this court has constantly explained, it is the duty of the first appellate court to remember that the parties to the court are entitled, as well on the questions of fact as on questions of law, to demand a decision of the court of first appeal, and that court cannot excuse itself from the task of weighing conflicting evidence and drawing its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and to make due allowance in this respect. 34. The Supreme Court of India underscored this duty in Garpat v State of Haryana (2010) 12 SCC 59 stating that: The first appellate court and the High court while dealing with an appeal is entitled and obliged as well to scan through and if need be re-appreciate the entire evidence and arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. 35. PW1 SA a student at [Particulars Withheld] university Kitengela campus testified that on 7th February, 2017 at 6 pm, she went to fuel her motor vehicle registration No. KBQ xxxB a Toyota Premio at Shell Petrol Station, Athi River. On her way back to Kitengela, she gave a lift to her colleague Timothy Abong o (PW2). They went to Kitengela where she bought some items and then made her way home. As she was dropping PW2, they were accosted by three people, the 1st appellant stood in front of the vehicle pointing a pistol at her while the 2nd appellant went to the driver s side and started hitting her with a gun butt asking her to open the door. She was pushed to the back seat. The attackers also got hold of PW2 who was trying to escape and forced him into the back seat. 36. The 2nd appellant got into the driver s seat while the 1st appellant sat with PW1 and PW2 at the back. The 2nd appellant reversed the vehicle and drove back towards where they were coming from. The other members of the gang entered the vehicle and she was forced to look down when they sat near the interior light. As they were about to approach the tarmac road, the robbers stopped and got the two out of the vehicle to a nearby bush. They forced her to sit down as PW2 was taken to a different sport. She was made to undress and the 1st appellant tied her hands and legs with her cloths and shoe laces. The 2nd appellant was also holding PW2. The 1st appellant threatened to rape her and beat her up but the 2nd appellant dissuaded him from doing that. They then left them and drove away after taking her phone. 37. She tried and untied herself, went to where PW2 was and assisted to untie him by cutting the laces using a razor blade that was in PW2 s pocket. She then put on her torn cloths and they walked to [Particulars Withheld] gate where they asked a motor cyclist to take them to the police station where they reported the matter and recorded their statements. 38. . They went to scene with police officers. They also called her brother who was the owner of the vehicle and informed him of the robbery. She went to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. She was later given a P3 form which was filled at Kitengela County Hospital on 5th May, 2017. Her phone was later recovered and she went to the police station and identified it. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 5 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 39. She testified that she was later called by the investigating officer and informed that a suspect had been arrested and she was asked to go and identify him. An identification parade was conducted and she identified the 1st appellant. She was again call that other suspects had been arrested and she was required to identify them. On 12th March, 2017 she went to the police station where an identification parade was conducted and she again identified the 2nd appellant. 40. In cross-examination PW1 told the court that she had seen the attackers well and that she gave their descriptions to the police when reporting the incident. However, the witness statement read out in court did not have descriptions. She stated that she saw it recorded in the OB; that there were lights from nearby homes and that the incident took place at 7.30 pm. 41. PW2 Timothy Abong o testified that on that day he was at Athi River when PW1 gave him a lift. They went to Kitengela where PW1 did some business and then they left for home. When they reached where he was to alight, they were approached by some people. The 2nd appellant went and stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them two others were attacking them from behind. He attempted to open the door and flee but he was pushed back by the 1st appellant who ordered him to jump to the back seat and lie between the front and back seat. He saw the 2nd appellant in front of the vehicle and identified him by means of the head lights. 42. He told the court that he did not see the 1st appellant clearly though he sat near him till later on when the vehicle stopped. When they were ordered to get out, the 1st appellant was waiting for him outside, grabbed him by the collar of the shirt and that was when he saw him properly. He also saw the 2nd appellant who was the driver by means of the interior light. 43. He was pulled away by the 1st appellant who tied him using shoe laces as he lay facing down. He was robbed of a cell phone Tecno 3ys valued at Kshs. 6,500 which he had purchased on 18th September, 2015 at Safaricom shop along Moi Avenue Nairobi. The phone was taken by the 1st appellant as well as Kshs. 500 - from his pocket. He was forced him to drink some concoction and was also beaten. 44. Later PW1 moved to where he was and assisted to untie him by cutting the shoe laces. They went to where motorcycles were and took one to the police station where they reported the incident; recorded statements and PW1 went to the scene with the police. They were then taken to Kitengela Medical Hospital for treatment. He was given a P3 form which was later filled. His phone and money were not recovered. 45. On 26th February, 2017 he was informed that a suspect had been arrested and asked to go and identify him. He went and identified the 1st appellant. Again on 10th March, 2017 he was informed that another suspect had been arrested. He went and identified the 2nd appellant at an identification parade. Cross-examined by 1st appellant, he stated that he used the light at the gate to see him and that at first he used the headlamp to identify 2nd appellant. Cross examined by 2nd appellant he told the court that he was able to see the gun and that he never saw the person s unique mark or his teeth. He also stated that he gave the police a description but he did not know whether it was recorded in the OB. He also stated that he attended the parade but that he never saw another fat person in the parade and that he was not interested in the height. 46. PW3 Jackson Njogu a resident of Mukuru Kayaba and a repairer of phones testified that in early February, he was in his shop when the 1st appellant took phones to him for servicing and resetting if the phone had been blocked. These were Tecno C9 and Sumsung J12. After servicing them, the 1st appellant asked him if he could buy them. He purchased the Tecno at Kshs. 5,000 and Samsung at Kshs. 2,000. He had previously purchased an Infix phone at Kshs. 3000 from him. On the first day he had gone with the 2nd appellant when he sold the infix phone to him. 47. PW3 sold the phones Sumsang and infix at Nairobi CBD next to Imenti House. He sold the Tecno phone to Stephen Omollo (PW4) for Kshs. 7,500. Omollo paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance of Kshs. 500 - later. Omollo went with the phone. Sometime in March 2017, Omollo went with CID officers to his hop looking for the phone. They arrested him and Omollo because the phone was stolen property. They were taken to Kitengela Police Station where they recorded their statements and later released. He denied that he knew the origin of the phone. He testified that the 1st appellant was common in Mukuru Kayaba and that he used to see him there. 48. PW4 Stephen Otieno Omollo also resident of Mukuru Kayaba selling second hand clothes, testified that he purchased a phone from PW3 at Kshs. 7,500 -. He paid Kshs. 7000 and was to pay the balance later. He tested the phone using his sim card and later bought another line. On 3rd March, 2017, PW3 called and asked him to go to his shop saying that he had delayed paying the balance http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 6 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR of Kshs. 500 -. PW3 took the phone and promised to release it to him upon paying the balance. 49. On 4th March, 2017 at 2 pm the area Chief called and asked him to go to his office. When he went there, he found two CID officers who asked him about the whereabouts of the phone. He took them to PW3 s place and both of them were arrested taken to Kitengela Police Station where they learnt that the phone had been robbed from someone. He recorded his statement and released on bond to be a witnesses. 50. PW5 Richard Kibor a clinical officer attached to Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 22nd May, 2017 he attended to PW2 who had a history of assault in a robbery incident. He had scars on the back of the hand right wrist joint and a scar on the right knee which had healed. The injuries were about 10 weeks old. The probable weapon used was a blunt object. He signed the P3 form on the same day which he produced as an exhibit. 51. PW6 Ann Nasieko Leyian also a clinical officer at Kitengela Sub County Hospital, testified that on 10th May, 2017 she attended to PW1 who also had a history of assault following a robbery incident. She had injuries on the forehead, bruises on other parts of the body. She classified the degree of injury as harm. The injuries were 3 months old. She signed the P3 form which was produced as an exhibit. According to the notes her cloths were torn. 52. PW7 No. 232777 CI Mohamed Osman of DCI Kitengela testified, that on 12th March, 2017 he was requested to conduct an identification parade. He assembled 9 members of the parade and two witnesses PW1 and PW2 were to participate in the parade concerning the 2nd appellant. He informed the 2nd appellant of the parade and asked him whether he was ready to participate in the parade to which he acceded. 53. The 2nd appellant declined to have a relative or an advocate witness the parade and signed to that effect. The witness asked the 2nd appellant to choose where to stand in the parade. Members of the parade were of similar height age and physical appearance with the 2nd appellant. He first called PW1 and told her that the person may or may not be among those assembled and asked her to touch the person if she was able to identify him. She identified the 2nd appellant who was standing between No. 6 and No.7 by touching him on the shoulder. He took PW1 away to the report office and called PW2 after he had asked the 2nd appellant if he wished to change his position but elected to maintain the same spot. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by touching him. The 2nd appellant made no comment. He asked the 2nd appellant if he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and he said that he was and signed the form produced as PEX 10. In cross examination, the witness told the court that he never had a conversation with the witness about identification features. 54. PW8 No. 236160 IP Edgar Nyala of DCI Kitengela testified that on 26th February, 2017 he was requested by the investigating officer to conduct an identification parade. He prepared members of the parade who were of similar physical appearance and complexion with the 1st appellant. He informed the 1st appellant the purpose of the parade and he agreed to participate in the parade and signed by thump printing on the form. He also identified the person who would be present during the parade a friend from Mukuru Kayaba. 55. The 1st appellant chose to stand between No. 4 and 5. After the parade was ready, he called PW1 and informed her that her attacker may or may not be in the parade. She identified the 1st appellant by touching him. He asked 1st appellant if he was satisfied with the conduct of the parade and he said he was. He again put his thumb print on the form. He then called PW2 and repeated the procedure as he had done with the PW1. PW2 identified the 2nd appellant by also touching him. The 2nd appellant said that he was satisfied with the way the parade was conducted and signed the form. 56. PW9 No. 235179 APC Moses Mwendwa of Land Mawe in South B division Nairobi, testified that on 25th February, 2017 at about 8.30 pm, he was called by members of the public over a person they had arrested at Mukuru Kayaba slum. They went and re arrested the 1st appellant from members of the public and took him to Hazina AP camp post; interrogated him and called the DCIO Kitengela who came and collected the 1st appellant as he had a case pending in that station after a person who had been arrested over phone stolen during a robbery mentioned him. In cross examination by the 1st appellant, the witness told the court that the police had alerted them that the person should be arrested when seen. 57. PW10 JOO brother to PW1 and owner of motor vehicle KBQ xxxB, testified that he had given the vehicle to Pw1 for use to take his children to school. He produced the logbook of the vehicle as an exhibit. He told the court that in February, 2017 he was informed by Kitengela police that the vehicle had been stolen. He talked to PW1 who confirmed that the vehicle had been taken http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 7 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR from her at gun point. 58. PW11 Daniel Hamisi who works with Safaricom at the law enforcement section, testified that on 20th February, 2017 he generated data on request by DCI Kitengela vide their letter dated 16th February, 2017 of particular phone with IMEI number over a case they were investigating. He generated data showing the number the handset had used between 5th February 2017 and 19th February, 2017. He established that only two numbers were used. 5th February, 2017, 0720xxxxxx. PW1 was the registered owner ID number [ .]. She had used the phone between 7th February, 2017 and 10th February, 2017 at 3.51 pm. There was no communication on 10th February, 2017. It was used by number 0725xxxxxx owned Stephen Otieno identity card No. [ .] until 19th February, 2017 and that from 10th February, 2017 the phone registered to be at Kapiti Crescent South B, Mukuru, Kayaba, Mathare North Area 4 but was mostly used at Mukuru Kayaba. 59. He told the court that each phone had a unique IMEI; that he generated the report by computer and produced it as PEX 16. He also signed a certificate under Section 65(8) as read with Section 106B of the Evidence Act and produced it as PEX 17. He produced the letter from police PEX 15. 60. PW12 No. 99958 PC Reyatone Mwalo of DCI Kitengela and the investigating officer, testified that on 8th February, 2017, he was instructed to investigate the case. He called PW1 and PW2 and recorded their statements. On 25th February, 2017 together with CIP Nyala, CP Kitonyi, Macharia and Chanja, they proceeded to Hazina AP Camp after they were notified that the 1st appellant had been arrested by members of the public and was being held there. They rearrested him and took him to Kitengela police station. 61. He also testified that on 10th March, 2017 he left the station in the company of CPL Gitonya, PC Mbogo and PC Chanya and the 1st appellant to Pipeline Nairobi to look for the 2nd appellant but they did not succeed in arresting him. They came back and got information that he had been seen at Kitengela and went to look for him. At about 7 pm they found him in a bar within Kitengela and arrested him with the assistance of the 1st appellant who identified him. They also confirmed his name from his identity card and took him to the station. PW1 and PW2 identified the 1st appellant on 26th February, 2017 at an identification parade conducted by PW7. 62. The witness further testified that he conducted a search with NTSA and got a copy of records for the motor vehicle KBQxxxB which showed that it belonged to PW10. He recovered PW1 s phone which he produced as PEX 7. PW1 had the receipt for the phone, IMEI 352879080015523 and produced the receipt as PEX 8. The phone was recovered from PW4 who led them to PW3. The appellants were then charged with the offence. 63. In cross examination, the witness admitted that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers. However, in re- examination, he told the court that the complainants gave descriptions of the attackers in their statements. He also told the court that PW3 gave information that led to the identification of the appellants and their eventual arrest. 64. When put on their defence the 1st appellant gave unsworn testimony while the 2nd appellant gave a sworn testimony. The 1st appellant testified that he used to run a hotel business at Mukuru Kayaba in Nairobi but closed in August, 2016 due to business differences with PW 3 and his sister. He moved to a different location and started selling scrap metal. He testified that on 25th February, 2017 he closed his business and was going home at 7.30 pm when he met a police officer Moses Mwendwa of Hazina AP Camp, an undercover agent who was well known to him. 65. The officer informed him that he had his report and asked him (1st appellant) to accompany him to the Chief s camp. He asked the 1st appellant what problem he had with his family and the 1st appellant told him. At the chief s camp, the officer instructed him to sit on the floor along the corridor. While sitting there, some people entered the office and when they came out, they informed him that they were CID officers from Kitengela and asked if he was Dennis Matheka Mutinda and he responded in the affirmative. They handcuffed him, put him in a vehicle without telling him why and took him to Kitengela police station. 66. Later he was asked how he knew PW3 and other people. He was interrogated on whether he had friends in Kitengela which he denied. He was put in the boot of the car and taken to a railway line where he saw the [Particulars Withheld] gate at about 4 a.m. He was beaten and injured. He was taken back to the station and later charged. 67. The 2nd appellant testified that he used to do business at Kitengala and Gikomba market selling shoes until 2006. He was later http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 8 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR employed by Bamburi Portland cement as a casual worker for 6 months then stopped. He later joined groups of land brokers. He would meet customers in bars for discussion. 68. On 20th December, 2018 there was a party at Akinyi s a bar owned by a police officer where they were drinking beer. According to the 2nd appellant, the police officer received a call that his wife (Akinyi) was drinking beer he had bought her. The officer went and chased them from the bar. They moved to Kings Bar, took their drinks and left. The 2nd appellant testified that he left for Mombasa on 3rd March, 2017. He later went to Kings Bar, passed by Tongei bar, paid his bill and stood outside waiting for a friend, Evans Chege. The wife of investigating officer saw him, went and pulled him inside the bar but he told her that he could only go in if her husband was around. Just as she pulled him, Mwalo came and the 2nd appellant asked her to leave him alone. 69. The appellant further testified that Mwalo was annoyed and thought he had an affair with his wife. He wanted to shoot the 2nd appellant but members of the public intervened. Mwalo later called for the vehicle and he was taken to the police station. Other officers came and beat him up because he was joking with a police officer s wife. Later at about 8 p.m., CI Osman and another officer came and told him that he would be charged with attempted rape and indecent assault; that Gatori asked how much money he had so that he could assist him and demanded Kshs. 200,000 - which he did not have. He was later put in the cell and told that he would be charged with robbery with violence. 70. He told the court that when he went for the identification parade EN came and he saw his photo on her phone; that the first person who identified him was holding the phone but PW9 locked him out; that five parades of 16 people were carried out including the one whose report was produced in court; that he was identified in the parade by use of his photographs in the phone but that he rejected the parade. He denied that the signature on the form was his, stating that his correct signature is on his identity. 71. After considering the above evidence, the trial court was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the appellants and sentenced them prompting this appeal. 72. I have considered the appeal and the evidence that was before the trial court. The issues that arise for determination in this appeal are; whether the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and whether the appellants were properly identified as the attackers. 73. The appellants were charged with the offence of robbery with violence. Section 296(2) provides that; If the offender is armed with any dangerous or offensive weapon or instrument, or is in company with one or more other person or persons, or if, at or immediately before or immediately after the time of the robbery, he wounds, beats, strikes or uses any other personal violence to any person, he shall be sentenced to death 74. The prosecution was therefore required to prove the ingredients under section 296(2) namely; that the attackers were more than one, or, were armed with dangerous weapons, or, used violence before, at or immediately before, or immediately after the commission of the offence. 75. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 was that they were driving in a motor vehicle when they were attacked by more than two men who were armed with a pistol. They were forced to the back seats of the car and beaten during the attack. The attackers were joined by more men; drove their victims to some open space where they again beat them up, undressed and robbed them of their phones and money. They were later abandoned in the area. They got assistance from motor cycle riders and taken to the police station where they reported the robbery incident. 76. From this evidence, there is no doubt that the attackers were more than one, were armed with a pistol and used violence on the complainants as they robbed them. The evidence of both PW5 and 6, clinical officers, also confirmed that the complainants had been assaulted during the attack. The prosecution evidence therefore proved the ingredients of the offence of robbery with violence. I am satisfied as the trial court was that the prosecution proved this ingredient of the offence as required by law. 77. That left the issue of whether the appellants were the persons who committed the offence and robbed the complainants. The appellants argued that they were not properly identified as the attackers and that PW1 and PW2 did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they reported the matter. They also submitted that conditions under which the offence was committed http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 9 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR were not conducive for a proper and positive identification. They argued that without giving descriptions of the attackers, the subsequent identification in the identification parades should not have been accepted. 78. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that conditions were favourable for positive identification. According to the prosecution counsel, the appellants shone touch lights when forcing their victims into the vehicle; the appellants and the complainants interacted for a while at close proximity; there were lights from nearby gates; the appellants walked in front of the vehicle with its headlights on and that there was bright moonlight illuminating the place, thus enabled the complainants see their attackers. 79. It was also argued that the appellants and the complainants were at close range and engaged one another in conversations; that PW1 was stripped naked as she was threatened with rape and therefore there was time and opportunity for the complainants to identify the appellants. It was also argued that PW3 was able to identify the 1st appellant as the person who sold to him the stolen phone that was later recovered. All this, it was argued, culminated in the appellants being positively identified at the identification parades. 80. I have considered the arguments by both sides on this issue. I have also perused the trial court s record and the impugned judgment. On the issue of whether the appellants were the attackers, the trial court considered the evidence of the witnesses on the role of the appellants and how they were identified as well as the appellants defence, and stated at page 6 of the judgment; I have considered the circumstances of the crimes-the dark hour and the available light at the time. I have considered the victims account of exactly how they were handed (sic) and the role the two accused played. I have found nothing to make me doubt that the witnesses said the truth. I am satisfied that the accused were properly identified into having convicted (sic) the two robberies. There is no other explanation except that it is the accused who accosted and robbed these complainants at gun point. 81. The trial court concluded that he appellants were properly identified and convicted them as charged on the two counts. 82. I have myself reviewed the evidence of both the prosecution and the appellants defence. There is no denial that the offence was committed in the evening between 7 and 730 pm. The complainants testified that the headlights of the vehicle were on and that one of the attackers stood in front of the vehicle and pointed a pistol at them forcing them to stop. One of the robbers took control of the vehicle and turned towards where the complainants were coming from. The other forced PW2 into the back seat while the door light was one. The complainants also testified that there were lights at the nearby gates illuminating the area. 83. The complainants further testified that the appellants took them to an open space where they spent some time with them; undressed and teased them; robbed them and tied them using shoe laces and cloths. They then left them and drove away. According to the complainants, there was bright moonlight. They told the court that a combination of all these factors enabled them to identify the appellants. When identification parades were conducted on different dates and time, both PW1 and PW2 picked out the appellants from the parades. 84. The appellants have argued that the conditions were not conducive for a positive identification. They have also argued that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. During cross examination, PW1 testified that she gave descriptions to the police. Her statement was read out in court but there were no descriptions. The witness however told the court that she had seen the descriptions recorded in the OB at the time the incident was reported. 85. In Republic v Eria Sebwato [1960] EA 174, the court held that where the evidence alleged to implicate an accused is entirely of identification, that evidence must be absolutely watertight to justify a conviction. 86. Similarly, in Kamau Njoroge v Republic (supra), the Court of Appeal held that; Dock identification is worthless unless preceded by a properly conducted identification parade. The complainant should also be asked to give description of the suspect, and police should arrange for a fair identification parade. On many occasions this court has held that such identification is almost worthless without an earlier identification parade. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 10 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 87. On dock identification or the practice of inviting a witness to identify an accused in the dock, the Court of Appeal again stated in John Stelen Ole Mwenda v Republic [1989] eKLR, that: The most serious complaint of the appellant was that the prosecution witnesses who claimed to have identified him were made to see him in the cells before they purported to identify him. To this was added the fact there was no identifying witnesses. In Republic v Cartwright (1914) 10 Cr Appeal R 219, it was held that the practice of inviting a witness to identify a defendant for the first time when the defendant is in the dock is undesirable and should be avoided if possible. Here the appellant complained that the prosecution witnesses were made to see him in the cells before they continued their testimony in the course of the trial. Such witnesses had not previously identified the appellant at an identification parade and no evidence was led that the holding of such a parade was impracticable or unnecessary or that there were any exceptional circumstances. So despite the fact that a large number of witnesses testified, in all the circumstances, the quality of the identification evidence was in our respective view poor. 88. In the present appeal, the appellants argued that there was no description of the attackers given to the police at the time of reporting the robbery. To this the complainants testified that they gave descriptions to the police and that this was recorded in the OB. PW12, the investigating officer, testified that he was assigned the case on 8th February 2017. He then perused the OB and noted the details of the complainants. He called them and recorded their statements. On 25th February 2017, he, with other officers, went to Hazina AP Camp and rearrested the 1st appellant who had been arrested by members of the public and handed over to AP officers at the camp. They later arrested the 2nd appellant within Kitengela with the assistance of the 1st appellant. 89. Identification parades were conducted for the two appellants on 26th February 2017 and 11th March 2017 respectively and they were positively identified by the complainants. The witness told the court in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers; that there were no photos of the 2nd appellant and that he did not interfere with the identification parade because he was not the one who conducted the parades. 90. Unlike in cases described as dock identification, identification parades were conducted in respect to the appellants case where both were positively identified by the complainants. PW12, the investigating officer, however admitted in cross examination that the complainants did not give descriptions of their attackers. This contradicted the complainants testimonies that they gave descriptions of their attackers. 91. I have perused the identification forms in respect of the appellants produced as PEX 9 and 10 by PW7 and 8. They were singed by appellants. The 1st appellant affixed his thumb print while the 2nd appellant singed initials AM to signify that they were satisfied with the way the parades had been conducted. I have also reviewed the evidence of PW7 and 8 who conducted those respective parades. I have no doubt that the parades were properly conducted. The issue however is how the complainants were able to identify the appellants without descriptions or special features of the attackers. On this, I will deal with the 2nd appellant first. 92. Regarding the 2nd appellant, the prosecution evidence was shaky on his role in the commission of the offence. Apart from the complainants evidence that they identified him, the conditions for his identification were not conducive. The complainants did not give descriptions of the attackers to the police when they had the first opportunity to report the robbery. PW12, the investigating officer, confirmed that no descriptions were given about the attackers. I am not satisfied that the prevailing conditions at the time the robbery was committed could enable a positive identification of the attackers, including the 2nd appellant. 93. There was also no clear evidence on how the police traced and arrested the 2nd appellant. According to PW12, the 1st appellant assisted them in tracing the 2nd appellant who was arrested at a bar within Kitengela. When the PW12 was cross examined by the 2nd appellant, he told the trial court they went with the 1st appellant who was in the boot of their car, left the car several metres away from the bar where they arrested the 2nd appellant and took him to the vehicle and the 1st appellant identified him. There was no evidence that it was the 1st appellant who pointed out the 2nd appellant in the bar before he was arrested. How the 2nd appellant was traced and arrested therefore remains unclear. 94. PW3 testified that when the 1st appellant first went to sell to him an Infix phone, he was with the 2nd appellant. However, that was before the robbery the subject of this appeal. That Infix phone was also not robbed from the complainants. Moreover, PW3 was not called to identify the 2nd appellant in the identification parade after his arrest. The fact that the arrest of the 2nd appellant was not clear was also a matter of concern to the trial court when it stated at page 5 of the judgment that the events leading to arrest of the 2nd appellant is a bit unclear. With this uncertainty, the trial court fell into error when it convicted the 2nd appellant on the basis of http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 11 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR unclear and doubtful evidence. 95. It is a long standing legal principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt. Any doubt in the prosecution case should go to the accused. Taking all this into account, I am satisfied that the prosecution did not prove its case against the 2nd appellant beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction was therefore unsafe. 96. Having considered the 2nd appellant s appeal, submissions and the authorities relied on; I find merit in his appeal. Consequently, his appeal is allowed, conviction quashed and sentence set aside. The 2nd appellant, Alexander Mutiso Peter, is hereby set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held. 97. Turning to the 1st appellant, his fate would have been the same as the 2nd appellant had his conviction been solely on the basis of identification. However, there was credible evidence that the 1st appellant sold phone robbed from the PW1 to PW3 who in turn sold the phone to PW4. The phone was traced through call data obtained from the mobile network provider, Safaricom. The stolen phone had been used on PW4 s line and that was how it was traced by the mobile phone provider. PW3 was traced and arrested. He had sold the phone to PW4 who used it. PW4 was also arrested. PW3 explained to the officers that it was the 1st appellant, a person well known to him that had sold the phone to him. He in turn sold it to PW4. They were taken to Kitengela police station where they recorded their statements. This is led to the arrest of the 1st appellant. 98. Even though the 1st appellant complained that the complainants never gave descriptions of the attackers and that his identification in the subsequent identification parades should not have been the basis of his conviction, there was other credible evidence of the stolen phone which he sold to PW3 that connected him with the offence. 99. The 1st appellant and PW3 were well known to each other. According to PW3, it was the 1st appellant who sold to him the stolen phone which he also sold to PW4 and was traced to them. The evidence of PW3 was clear that the phone originated from the 1st appellant. The 1st appellant argued that there was business rivalry between him and PW3 and his sister which PW3 and PW12, the investigating officer, denied saying it was not true. 100. The fact of the recovery of the stolen phone which was connected with the 1st appellant, introduced the doctrine of recent possession. In Issac Nganga Kahiga alias Peter Nganga Kahiga v Republic [2005] eKLR, the Court of Appeal held: It is trite law that before a court can rely on the doctrine of recent possession as a basis of conviction in a criminal case, the possession must be positively proved. In other words, there must be proof, first that the property was found with the suspect, and secondly that, the property is positively the property of the complainant, thirdly that the property was recently stolen from the complainant. The proof as to time, as has been stated over and over again, will depend on the easiness with which the stolen properties can move from one person to another. 101. It must be made clear that the stolen phone was not found in the 1st appellant s possession. It was traced to PW4 then to PW3 who purchased it from the 1st appellant. The chain of possession was therefore traced to the 1st appellant. PW3 and the 1st appellant were known to each well and it was not the first time the 1st appellant was taking phones to PW3 for repairs or flushing . The 1st appellant had previously sold to PW3 other phones which PW3 sold within Nairobi Central Business District. 102. The 1st appellant argued that he was not informed of his right to cross examine his co-accused. In his view, this failure vitiated his trial. I have gone through the trial court s record and the 2nd appellant s defence. The 2nd appellant did not make any reference to the 1st appellant at all. I do not think therefore failure to cross examine the 2nd appellant caused the 1st appellant any prejudice. 103. With this uncontroverted evidence, the 1st appellant was well connected with the offence. The phone had recently been robbed from the complainants at gun point. It was properly identified through the unique IMEI number. For that reason, I am satisfied that the 1st appellant was properly connected to the offence and his conviction was sound. His appeal fails. The conviction upheld. 104. On sentence, the 1st appellant was sentenced to death in count 1 while count 2 was held in abeyance. However, according to the Supreme Court decision in the Muruatetu case, death sentence is no longer mandatory in these cases. The death sentence is therefore set aside. In place therefor, the 1st appellant Dennis Matheka Mutinda alias stupid, is sentenced to twenty (20) years imprisonment in each count. http: www.kenyalaw.org - Page 12 13 Dennis Mutinda Matheka another v Republic [2020] eKLR 105. The law requires that where an accused is sentenced to a term of years, the period spent in remand be considered when sentencing. According to the charge sheet, the 1st appellant was arrested on 25th February 2017 and was sentenced on 14th September 2018. The sentences of twenty (20) years for each count shall therefore run concurrently from 25th February 2017. Orders accordingly Dated, signed and delivered at Kajiado this 16th day of October 2020.
